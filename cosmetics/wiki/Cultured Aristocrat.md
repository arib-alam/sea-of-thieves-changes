| Cultured Aristocrat Hull | Cultured Aristocrat Lantern | Calliope's Favour |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------- |
| A ship is basically just a big, floating outfit accessory. | An elegant lantern, perfect for poetry in the garden at midnight. Or pirate stuff, if you insist. | An opulent vase, commissioned at great expense by a Court Chamberlain. He stored old keys in it. |

| Cultured Aristocrat Boots | Cultured Aristocrat Dress | Cultured Aristocrat Hook |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Boots so beautiful, your underlings will be lining up to lick them. | Classy and cream-coloured, this dress will look great at any event - but may not stand up to grog stains. | Even those of noble bearing occasionally find themselves in need of a replacement limb. |

| Cultured Aristocrat Concertina | Cultured Aristocrat Fishing Rod | Cultured Aristocrat Speaking Trumpet |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| If you really must consort with ruffians, take this instrument to distract them. Do not attempt conversation. | One does not 'go fishing'. One is a merely an aficionado of maritime cuisine procurement. | One does not raise one's voice to address one's crew. Use this instead. |

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Other pirates should know that you’re the cream of the crop. Stand proud at this jeweled wheel. | Play a charming ditty for your high society friends… Or for your pirate scum mates. | Seems a shame to get dirt and sand on this shovel. But, more treasure means more finery. |

| Cultured Aristocrat Eye of Reach | Cultured Aristocrat Banjo | Cultured Aristocrat Tankard |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Sometimes altercations require a delicate touch from afar, instead of being dragged into the mud. | The banjo is a rather drab instrument, but this one has been ornately upgraded to suit your tastes. | The taverns may be filthy and common, but that doesn't mean your tankard has to be. |

| Cultured Aristocrat Sails | Cultured Aristocrat Trousers | Cultured Aristocrat Bucket |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| These sails are made from the finest silk. You're a pirate, not a barbarian. | They're not ‘white' trousers; rather, they're an exquisite melding of hand-picked, cream-coloured hues. | This bucket is so posh and ornate that the water it bails feels fancy. |

| ------------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| This opulent blunderbuss really sets off the bloodthirsty glint in your eye. | This ornate compass always guides you to port, where you can show it off then leave. | You didn't say 'best-dressed buccaneer', but if people want to say it about you, let them. |
