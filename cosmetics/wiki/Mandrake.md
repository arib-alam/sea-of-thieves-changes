# Mandrake

| Personal Growth Emote | Mandrake Hull | Mandrake Pistol |
| --------------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| No description | A hull as green as jeweled spring leaves and the faces of other crews as you ram them at full speed. | Botanists are absolutely entranced by this palnt-based pistol. Some are already trying to grow their own armaments. |

| Mandrake Wheel | Mandrake Sails | Mandrake Blunderbuss |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| Considering the way it keeps the wheel wrapped in vines and tendrils, it's almost like the plant is steering the ship. | Descend upon other ships like a rolling tide of briars, teeth, and thorns. Plants are so calming. | Don't go sniffing this blunderbuss' enticing flower - the only thing you'll be smelling is gunpowder. And blood. |

| Mandrake Cannon Flare | Mandrake Eye of Reach | Mandrake Costume (Plain) |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Enemy crews can admire a tasteful cerise flourish as their hull explodes beneath them. | For those on long assassination missions, the foliage growing out of this gun works as fantastic camouflage. | Half human, half plant, all deadly - dress up as the flesh-eating Mandrake with this thorny outfit. |

| Mandrake Costume (Tinted skin) | Mandrake Figurehead | Mandrake Capstan |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Half human, half plant, all deadly - dress up as the flesh-eating Mandrake with this thorny outfit. | It's a trap! And a hardy perennial that shrugs off brine and bad weather alike. | It's said that this flower takes 20 years to bloom, and the aroma could fell in elephant. Let's hope it doesn't happen during an anchor turn. |

| Mandrake Cannons | Mandrake Speaking Trumpet | Mandrake Flag |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ------------- |
| Knotted with thorny vines and other flora, these brassy cannons need maintaining with a pair of secateurs. | Pirates swear that this bristly speaking trumpet is whispering for someone to feed it. | Shows a neat curl of spiky vine, not a bramble fishing hook, although pirates will try anything once. |

| Mandrake Cutlass | Collector's Mandrake Sails | Collector's Mandrake Figurehead |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Thanks to the ravenous plant that grows from this brass blade, it quite literally thirsts for blood. | These sails depict the predatory power of the mandrake in full bloom, terrifying other crews even in the dead of night. | This variant of the mandrake mutates in unexpected ways. Those jaws will look truly fearsome at the bow of your ship. |
