# Frostbite

| Frostbite Dress | Frostbite Concertina | Frostbite Eyepatch |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| A dress made of thick fabric that provides both style and snugness. | A fine accompaniment to a shanty while the workout helps to keep your arms nice and toasty. | A glittering eyepatch that could almost have been carved from solid ice. Brr. |

| Frostbite Hook | Frostbite Beard | Frostbite Jacket |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| A hook so hardy, you could even use it to carve your initials into an iceberg. | A thick beard helps retain body heat. Adorning it with glittering chunks of ice? Not so much. | A thick jacket that keeps out the cold. Handy if you're stuck up in the crow's nest. |

| Frostbite Braided Hair | Frostbite Cutlass | Frostbite Flag |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| An elegant braid will keep your hair neatly in place. Unfreezing it later is another matter. | Bringing a whole new meaning to the cold bite of steel. | Comes with a convenient arrow just in case you're really struggling to work out which way the wind is blowing. |

| Frostbite Fishing Rod | Frostbite Drum | Frostbite Cannons |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| Ice fishing is a popular pastime in many places – but, oddly, not in The Devil's Roar... | If the cold starts getting to you, why not dance along to the beat and warm yourself up? | It's an everyday pirate activity to fire the cannons - why not ice them instead? |
