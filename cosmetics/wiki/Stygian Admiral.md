# Stygian Admiral

| Stygian Admiral Trousers | Stygian Admiral Hat | Stygian Admiral Pegleg |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| A fine pair of immaculately pressed breeches that are nearly as uptight as you are. | A hat makes the pirate, so look no further than this distinguished but impractical headwear. | A wooden leg doesn't lessen your duty. It's no excuse for getting stuck in the deck grille though. |

| Both practical and formal, in the highly unlikely chance of attending a society ball on the seas. | Buckles so polished that you could eat a banquet off them. It's a pity all you have is bananas. | Don't wipe sea spray from your eyes or you'll be wearing an eyepatch too. |

| Stygian Admiral Shirt | Stygian Admiral Gloves | Stygian Admiral Eyepatch |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Extra starch ensures you'll stay smart in the roughest of storms. Smarter pirates avoid them though. | Getting your hands dirty is for dishonourable types, so wear these gloves and sniff your innocence. | Promotes an air of undoubted experience in battle, just don't let your crew see it's just for show. |

| Stygian Admiral Belt | Stygian Admiral Jacket |

| The large buckle reflects your stature, but also increases the chance of being struck by lightning. | We'll keep adding silver buttons until everyone's fooled into giving you the desired respect. |
