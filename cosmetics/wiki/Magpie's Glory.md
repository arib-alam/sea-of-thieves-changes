# Magpie's Glory

| Magpie's Glory Bucket | Magpie's Glory Cannons | Magpie's Glory Fishing Rod |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| A legendary bucket for legendary deeds - from putting out fires to throwing vomit on an enemy. | A stash of Athena's Fortune Fireworks launched from these cannons is a great way to honour the Pirate Lord. | A surprisingly subdued fishing rod. Well, not even Pirate Legends need to show off all the time... |

| Magpie's Glory Tankard | Magpie's Glory Wheel | Magpie's Glory Hurdy-Gurdy |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| A twisting tankard with a wide, sturdy base. Raise a toast to the Pirate Lord! | An immaculate golden wheel, sadly destined to be covered by grubby pirate fingerprints. | Being a skilled musician opens up many paths in life - like the one leading to the Pirate Lord's hideout. |

| Magpie's Glory Hull | Legendary Spirit Cutlass | Magpie's Glory Concertina |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Brilliant white and glittering gold, practically guaranteed to dazzle all who spy you. | Fear not; though ethereal, this cutlass blocks and bites as truly as any earthly steel. | Granted, the Athena's Fortune hideout already has a band, but you never know when they might need an opening act... |

| Magpie's Glory Figurehead | Magpie's Glory Compass | Magpie's Glory Speaking Trumpet |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| It is said that the flame borne by this figurehead was taken straight from the Well of Fates... | Know that this instrument will guide you as well as the Pirate Lord himself. | Never about the gold, it's about shouting about the glory. |

| Legendary Spirit Pistol | Legendary Spirit Eye of Reach | Magpie's Glory Banjo |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Pull the trigger to make more ghosts. | Rumour has it this weapon was once used by the Pirate Lord himself, to shoot the lid off a bottle of grog... | Some say a bard has recently appeared, eager to record Pirate Legends' adventures in song... |

| Legendary Spirit Blunderbuss | Magpie's Glory Capstan | Magpie's Glory Flag |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| The blunderbuss is always a fearsome weapon, especially when it's wielded by a mighty Pirate Legend. | The capstan of a ludicrously opulent ship, once commissioned by the Pirate Lord. | The perils of a life at sea can take their toll on even the most magnificent flag. |

| Magpie's Glory Lantern | Magpie's Glory Sails | Magpie's Glory Drum |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| The Pirate Lord himself recommends this to light your way in the darkest of places. | The Pirate Lord himself specified the unusual, swirling design on these sails, but refused to be drawn upon its meaning. | The shipwright, Magpie, was such a perfectionist he ensured that all of his ships carried a full complement of instruments. |

| Magpie's Glory Pocket Watch | Magpie's Glory Shovel | Magpie's Glory Spyglass |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Time how long it takes for other pirates to join you as a Legend. They definitely won't find it annoying. | Use this Athena's Fortune award for unearthing or interring amazing acquisitions. | You are genuinely Athena's Fortunate to get your hands on this legendary item. |
