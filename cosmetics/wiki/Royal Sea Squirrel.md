# Royal Sea Squirrel

| Royal Sea Squirrel Hull | Royal Sea Squirrel Trinket | Collector's Royal Sea Squirrel Sails |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| A colourful, fine hull paint that looks regal from the yardarm to the mighty poop deck. | If you're looking for something to even up a wonky table, this statue of a royal rodent and his golden acorn would work a treat. | Legend says that the story of a squirrel becoming king all took place on one very bad day. |

| Royal Sea Squirrel Wheel | Royal Sea Squirrel Capstan | Royal Sea Squirrel Sails |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| No matter how sober you were before, this wheel always seems to steer you towards an open tavern. | Spins around as easily as a leaping squirrel's tail, according to dubious drunken sightings. | The crown and tankards encourage drinking with dignity. Or is it drinking with stolen jewellery? |

| Royal Sea Squirrel Flag | Royal Sea Squirrel Cannon | Royal Sea Squirrel Figurehead |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| The heraldry here tells every pirate that you hoard your loot like a squirrel hoards acorns. See? | These make short work of weasels, goblins and bears. Oh my! | This depicts a rather regal rascal, clearly fond of a grog but always coming out on top! |

| When your tankard runs over with foaming grog, you, sir, are a king among squirrels and men. |
