| Dark Blond Hair | Dark Brown Hair | Sailor Compass |
| --------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| A darker blond shade reminiscent of wet sand, volcanic shores and mysterious folk. | A darker shade of brown that hides all the soil you get covered in after digging up a few chests. | A finely crafted navigational aid. If you're wearing two eyepatches. |

| Sailor Captain's Logbook | Red Flag | Sailor Ship's Banner |
| ------------------------ | -------- | -------------------- |
| A traditional seafaring design for the cover of your Captain's Logbook. | After a vicious battle, a red flag is one less thing to clean. | All who approach a Captained ship will see its name proudly displayed on banners like these. |

| Flag Of The Reaper's Mark | Grass Green Sailor Sails | Sailor Hook |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------- |
| BEWARE: The Reaper's Mark whispers across the waves and glows with an accursed light. The location of a ship bearing this flag will be known to all. | Bright green, perfect camouflage if you run aground in someone's garden. | Built to the same unexceptional standards for many years. |

| Sailor Double Barrel Pistol | Sailor Blunderbuss | Alliance Pennant |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Fire two shots before having to reload, or deal twice the damage in one shot. | Fires a spread of shot just as good as those more interesting looking blunderbusses. | Fly the Alliance Pennant to offer the formation of an alliance to another crew. When in an Alliance all crews will take a cut from each other's treasure. |

| Burgundy Sailor Bandana | Sailor Hull | Sailor Concertina |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Holds your hair out of your face and hides any bloodstains. What more could you ask for? | Hull rhymes with dull, which couldn't be any more appropriate for this. | If blandness is music to your ears, then this will play the right tune for you. |

| Sailor Captain's Table | Sleep Emote | Sailor Tankard |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| If this reliable table wasn't here to hold Voyages, the floor would be full of knife-marks by now. | If you canâ€™t sleep, try counting Ruby Splashtails. | If you drink enough grog then this could possibly look like a decent tankard. |

| Sailor Hurdy-Gurdy | Blue Flag | Sailor Captain's Chandelier |
| ------------------ | --------- | --------------------------- |
| It might look expensive, but don't be fooled. It's as cheap as the rest of the range. | It's a flag. It's blue. It's a blue flag. | It's a trifle ostentatious, but who can resist their own personal chandelier? |

| Point Emote | Dark Grey Hair | Black Underwear |
| ----------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Itâ€™s rude to point. | Just a shade away from black, like many a veteran pirate's heart. | Just in case your clothes are stolen by another pirate, wear some impressive underwear. |

| Yellow Underwear | Sailor Lantern | Sailor Boots |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| Just in case your clothes are stolen by another pirate, wear some impressive underwear. | Lights up the dark, but also brings attention to the dullness of your lantern. | Made by the same family of unambitious bootmakers for three generations. |

| Solemn Moustache | Yellow Sailor Bandana | Black Flag |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ---------- |
| Maintain an air of dignity during lengthy grog sessions and participation in skulduggery. | Mimic the look of wrapping a banana peel around your head without smearing fruit on your face. | Moody, mysterious and always in fashion. |

| Sailor Bucket | White Flag | Black Sailor Bandana |

| Sailor Eyepatch | Sailor Belt | Royal Blue Sailor Sails |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| Not a patch on those fancier ones, but who cares? | Not really a belt, more a piece of cloth that sort of looks like a belt. | Now that's a handsome set of sails! You look like pirate royalty, now. |

| Sailor Shovel | Sailor Figurehead | Sailor Gloves |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| Perfect if all you want from a shovel is to dig some earth. Preferably when no-one is watching. | Pirates are undecided whether having this on the front of your ship is better than nothing at all. | Plain gloves. Good for covering your hands and not much else. |

| Yellow Sailor Sails | Sailor Cutlass | Bone White Hair |
| ------------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Some find it colourful, some find it unsettling, some get hungry for bananas. | Some say a pirate is defined by his sword. If so, then this makes you a very average pirate. | Sporting this bone-white and distinguished hair, seagull poops are much less noticeable on you. |

| Sailor Pegleg | Sailor Cannons | Sailor Jacket |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Stand up for simplicity by strapping on this no-frills wooden leg. | Standard cannons, not pretty, not fancy, but good at making holes in pirates and ships alike. | Step out in style and become a pirate icon by wearing a jacket that isn't this one. |

| Burgundy Sailor Sails | Sailor Wheel | Navy Blue Sailor Sails |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| Stylish, mysterious and hides all the bloodstains. | The basic wheel, a simple but vital part of any ship. Also a merciless splinter delivery system. | The sea is blue, the sky is blue, might as well blend in. |

| Rainbow Flag | Strawberry Blond Hair | Silver Grey Hair |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ---------------- |

| Well Groomed Beard | Sailor Captain's Curtains | Blue Sailor Bandana |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Trim this beard as often as your sails and you'll be well respected. Or end up grounding your ship. | Twin curtains to frame the Captain's Table, rescued from the wreck of someone else's Galleon. | Unlock some blue-sky thinking with a suitably coloured headpiece. |
