# Courage of Captaincy

| Courage of Captaincy Beard | Courage of Captaincy Jacket | Courage of Captaincy Eyepatch |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| A beard can symbolise many things - authority, experience and a nice warm chin,  for example. | A bright violet jacket, because a ship's Captain should never settle for being inconspicuous. | A golden crest with a purple strap, this is more like a badge of honour than an eyepatch. |
