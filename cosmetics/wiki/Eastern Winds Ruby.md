# Eastern Winds Ruby

| Eastern Winds Ruby Bucket | Eastern Winds Ruby Padded Belt | Eastern Winds Ruby Flag |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| A bucket so fine, it almost seems a shame to fill it with something as mundane as seawater. | Accentuate your waist with a bright shock of crimson. | Are the holes of this tattered flag from years of use? Or has it been singed by a dragon's flaming breath? |

| Eastern Winds Ruby Fishing Rod | Eastern Winds Ruby Pristine Jacket | Eastern Winds Ruby Concertina |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Cast this rod and watch the fishing line dance through the air, like a dragon flying across the sky. | Ensure you always look dignified in this buttoned-up piece. | Even the keys of this gorgeous concertina are made from glittering gems. It's almost TOO nice. |

| Eastern Winds Ruby Spyglass | Eastern Winds Ruby Wheel | Eastern Winds Ruby Shovel |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Helps check the skies for low-flying dragons - or maybe just for incoming fire. | If the ship on this ship's wheel is upside down, you're either turning or something's gone horribly wrong. | In colder regions, this shovel might be used to dig up snow. You'll just have to settle for gold. |

| Eastern Winds Ruby Cannons | Eastern Winds Ruby Short Jacket | Eastern Winds Ruby Speaking Trumpet |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| In the pantheon of mythical beasts, a dragon seems the most suitable one for decorating a cannon. | In the warm climate of the Sea of Thieves, you don't always want a full-length overcoat. | Let your gracious greetings carry far across the waves using this opulent speaking trumpet. |

| Eastern Winds Ruby Capstan | Eastern Winds Ruby Hat | Eastern Winds Ruby Pocket Watch |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Look lively when manning this jewel-encrusted capstan - unless you like your anchor raising to drag on. | Made from the finest silk, the feather in this cap is said to be from an imperial governor's favourite peacock. | No matter how often you check your shiny new pocket watch, it still won't be time for dinner. |

| Eastern Winds Ruby Wrap Dress | Eastern Winds Ruby Hull | Eastern Winds Ruby Figurehead |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Simple yet elegant, this dress is perfect for when you need to look good in a hurry. | Soar gracefully over the waves, just like the dragon painted on the side of this striking hull. | Some pirates like to opt for an understated figurehead. This glittering ruby dragon is not one of them. |

| Eastern Winds Ruby Hurdy-Gurdy | Eastern Winds Ruby Bejewelled Gloves | Eastern Winds Ruby Lantern |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| The bejewelled crank of this hurdy-gurdy is probably worth the ransom of an entire royal family. | The glittering ruby on your wrist is an eye-catching distraction for anyone who crosses blades with you. | The ruby dragons on its handle are just one of the many ways this lantern exudes quality. |

| Eastern Winds Ruby Sturdy Boots | Eastern Winds Ruby Compass | Eastern Winds Ruby Drum |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| The supple leather of these shoes is both devastatingly stylish and extremely comfortable. | This point of this compass is said to follow a dragon's flight path. Let's hope it's flying where you're going. | Vigorous drum beats are said to mirror a dragon's mating call. Maybe take it easy with that next drum solo. |

| Eastern Winds Ruby Tankard | Eastern Winds Ruby Sails | Eastern Winds Ruby Banjo |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| When drinking from this posh tankard, your pinkie just can't help pointing out as a show of respect. | While the dragon on these sails may be resting, expect the crew sailing under it to be roaring into battle. | With its ornate dragon design, this imported banjo looks even better than it sounds. |
