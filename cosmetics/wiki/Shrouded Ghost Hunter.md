# Shrouded Ghost Hunter

| Where Is It Emote | Collector's Shrouded Ghost Hunter Sails | Shrouded Ghost Hunter Capstan |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| No description | A starkly-coloured set of sails that will terrify any foe, let alone that elusive megalodon. | A vicious capstan that is best used on a ship with a very tidy, dry, slip-free deck. |

| Shrouded Ghost Hunter Cannons | Shrouded Ghost Hunter Sails | Shrouded Ghost Hunter Costume (Plain) |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Adorned with primal spears, these cannons are ready to take down nature's most elusive monster. | Bold, dramatic sails that also provide a handy reminder of what you're hunting. | Hunt down pirates and Megalodons alike in a costume adorned with grisly trophies. |

| Shrouded Ghost Hunter Blunderbuss | Shrouded Ghost Hunter Wheel | Shrouded Ghost Hunter Costume (White-Skinned) |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Megalodon hunters favour this gun because it can't miss... when you're harpooned to a Megalodon. | Perhaps the shark's jaws that adorn this wheel will help it steer towards your ocean prey. | Some pirates become so obsessed with finding the Shrouded Ghost that they take on its appearance. |

| The crossed spears of dedicated shark hunters adorn this pale hull. | This flag is raised by Shrouded Ghost hunters; here is a crew that has chosen to dance with doom. | Three spears stained with Shrouded Ghost blood - truly for a crew of merciless and peerless hunters! |
