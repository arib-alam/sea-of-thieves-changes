# Pet Protector

| Pet Protector Flag | Pet Protector Hull | Pet Protector Sails |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| A flag that declares devotion to all animal companions, or ownership of one extremely large dog. | A ship never feels like more of a home than when you share its decks with a loyal animal companion. | Advocate for your animal allies by giving your whole ship the appearance of a Pet Chest. |

| Pet Protector Collector's Sails | Pet Protector Cannons | Pet Protector Wheel |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Anyone who fires your pet out of a cannon after you've raised these sails is really just asking for trouble. | Gives a new meaning to your opponents being in the doghouse, doesn't it? | Is there any better feeling than a ship's wheel beneath your hand, a sea breeze in your hair and a faithful pet at your side? |

| Pet Protector Capstan | Pet Protector Figurehead | Pet Protector Collector's Figurehead |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Many a ship's cat will enjoy exploring this capstan, though they're no help at all when raising the anchor. | Several pets carved from a single block of wood, giving them no real choice but to get along famously. | When the sun hits them just right, you could almost believe these stunning carvings have come to life. |
