# Silver Sepulchre

| Silver Sepulchre Cutlass | Silver Sepulchre Lantern | Silver Sepulchre Hull |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| A needle-like blade primed for striking right at the cold hearts of your enemies. | A stake, fire and silver - everything you need to take down even the most fearsome creatures of the night. | A thin dusting of silver mixed in with the paint will do wonders for keeping out any ghouls. |

| Silver Sepulchre Gloves | Silver Sepulchre Cannons | Silver Sepulchre Flag |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| An elegant blend of protection and style, with enough silver to warn away the worst kind of monsters. | Crossbows aren't as threatening to a ship as they are to a vampire, but the cannonballs certainly will be. | Few pirates know the symbol emblazoned on this flag, but those who do recognise you as a champion of the light. |

| Silver Sepulchre Hat | Silver Sepulchre Eye of Reach | Silver Sepulchre Capstan |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Hunters of unnatural foes have a tradition of keeping a few silver bullets in their hat for good luck. | Hunting monstrous creatures of the night is often better done at a distance. | In a world where monsters lurk in the shadows, you can never have too many stakes. |

| Silver Sepulchre Pistol | Silver Sepulchre Sails | Silver Sepulchre Collector's Sails |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| It lacks the satisfying twang of a crossbow, but stings just the same. | Let these sails act as a sombre warning to any creature of the night who might think you easy prey. | Monsters on the Sea of Thieves may not need to fear crossbows, but they should fear you. |

| Silver Sepulchre Collector's Figurehead | Silver Sepulchre Figurehead | Silver Sepulchre Blunderbuss |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Pirates who don't watch themselves around this contraption are liable to lose a few fingers. | Ramming your enemies is not always advisable, but this figurehead will at least ensure you cause lasting damage. | The detailed silver plating might look decorative, but this weapon is no less devastating for it. |

| Silver Sepulchre Jacket | Silver Sepulchre Wheel |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| There's not much call for silver bullets on the Sea of Thieves, but having them close makes you feel safer all the same. | When you were told to always keep a stake close at hand, this probably isn't what they meant. |
