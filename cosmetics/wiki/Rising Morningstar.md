# Rising Morningstar

| Rising Morningstar Hook | Rising Morningstar Dress Jacket | Rising Morningstar Captain Gloves |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| A Morningstar crewman wore just such a hook, claiming his hand was lost defending the ship. | A recreation of the uniform of the Morningstar, whose crew deserve to live in our memories. | A replica of the gloves Captain Slate wore to weather the cold seas while sailing The Wilds. |

| Rising Morningstar Belt | Rising Morningstar Crew Jacket | Rising Morningstar Battle Hat |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| A simple belt - Eli Slate chose uniforms for dignity, not showboating. He was no Sea Dog! | After the fate of Eli Slate's crew was uncovered, this jacket was made to honour those bold sailors. | Eli Slate allowed two types of hat; one for appearing proper at the Outpost, the other for battle. |

| Rising Morningstar Boots | Rising Morningstar Dress | Rising Morningstar Crew Gloves |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Eli Slate forbade any crewmate from walking barefoot on ship. A splinter could cost a battle! | For formal events, Slate designed this dress to smarten up his crew. A man of hidden talents. | Morningstar crew were made to wear gloves after a halyard slip left a nasty incident of rope burn. |

| Rising Morningstar Pegleg | Rising Morningstar Trousers | Rising Morningstar Dress Hat |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Should a Morningstar crewmate lose a leg in service, they could claim one pegleg or a month's grog. | These replicate the sturdy trousers of the Morningstar uniform - be proud to don them. | This hat should be for formal muster only, but Slate did relax his hat policy as age softened him. |
