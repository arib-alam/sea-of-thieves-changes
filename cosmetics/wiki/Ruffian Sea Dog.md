# Ruffian Sea Dog

| Ruffian Sea Dog Banjo | Ruffian Sea Dog Spyglass | Ruffian Sea Dog Concertina |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| A banjo for the salt of the earth - sturdy, simple and tuned to perfection. | Allows you to get a close up of the terror in your rival's eyes. | Bilge Rat Beanland played the very first shanty ever heard on one of these. |

| Ruffian Sea Dog Lantern | Ruffian Sea Dog Shovel | Ruffian Sea Dog Eyepatch |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Built to last, a heavy duty lantern that won't go out even when dropped from the crow's nest. | Certified to have dug up at least a hundred chests, it's a shovel you can rely on. | Crafted by stitching two whole different fabrics together. The Sea Dogs were a talented bunch. |

| Ruffian Sea Dog Trousers | Ruffian Sea Dog Hook | Ruffian Sea Dog Fishing Rod |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Double stitched. Why risk an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction when bending over to load a cannon? | Forged from old cutlasses discarded by veteran crews. | From Sailor's Bounty to Ashen Reaches, a stalwart rod like this can keep a pirate well-fed. |

| Ruffian Sea Dog Speaking Trumpet | Ruffian Sea Dog Dress | Ruffian Sea Dog Pocket Watch |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Hundreds of orders have been barked through this speaking trumpet, and hundreds more ignored. | It might look ridiculous on the dancefloor, but it's nearly as good as wearing armour. | It's been bitten by a shark and swallowed by a Kraken. Yet it still works! |

| Ruffian Sea Dog Pistol | Ruffian Sea Dog Shirt | Ruffian Sea Dog Hull |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| Its design has remained stubbornly unchanged since the first pirate sailed into the Sea of Thieves. | Made from the hammocks that once hung below decks in the renowned galleon, The Black Dog. | Made from trees felled by pirate pioneers on Lone Cove. Also full of very old woodworms. |

| Ruffian Sea Dog Compass | Ruffian Sea Dog Belt | Ruffian Sea Dog Hat |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| No-one had ever sailed east until the buccaneering forefathers invented this. | Nothing says &quot;Sea Dog&quot; quite like wearing a belt made from a dog's collar. Just don't smell it. | Once used by wily scoundrels to hide an extra cannonball, despite the headaches it caused. |

| Ruffian Sea Dog Hurdy-Gurdy | Ruffian Sea Dog Boots | Ruffian Sea Dog Gloves |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Part time pirates will have absolutely no idea what this is. You'll know better, of course. | Planning a trip to The Wilds? Then you'll need these sturdy boots to survive its razor-sharp rocks. | Plenty of room to slip a few coins inside to fight your way out of any tavern brawl. |

| Ruffian Sea Dog Cutlass | Ruffian Sea Dog Jacket | Ruffian Sea Dog Blunderbuss |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Rivals have been known to leap into shark infested waters to escape this menacing blade. | Rumour has it that next season's model will even be resistant to lightning strikes. | Spread the word, this is the original and still the best Skeleton horde stopper. |

| Ruffian Sea Dog Hair | Ruffian Sea Dog Figurehead | Ruffian Sea Dog Flag |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| The classic long back and sides, favoured by genuine pirates throughout the seas. | The first crew of Sea Dogs battled giant skeletons and made trophies out of their skulls. | The flag of a real pirate. Raise it proudly and don't forget to shake off any old gunpowder! |

| Ruffian Sea Dog Sails | Ruffian Sea Dog Cannons | Ruffian Sea Dog Drum |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| The most recognised sail on the seas, but only because they've refused to change the dated design. | These cannons may be a bit rough around the edges, but they're always ready for battle. | This can't help you play better but it also can't help you play worse. Win win. |

| Ruffian Sea Dog Wheel | Ruffian Sea Dog Bucket | Ruffian Sea Dog Capstan |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| This clunking, clattering wheel has a hefty feel to it that appeals to sturdy sailors. | To become the scourge of the seas you occasionally need to bail some of it out. | Unlocked by reaching reputation level 10 in the Order of Souls. |

| Ruffian Sea Dog Eye of Reach | Ruffian Sea Dog Tankard | Ruffian Sea Dog Pegleg |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| When Blind Bob was not quite so blind, he added his spyglass to a musket and created this. | When your ship goes down, what's the first thing a true pirate should save from a watery grave? | Who knew taking a bit of old rope and turning a hook upside down would make such a fetching new leg? |

| Ruffian Sea Dog Beard |
| --------------------- |
| Wiry and rough, making it to ideal to rub into your enemies faces as an extra weapon. |
