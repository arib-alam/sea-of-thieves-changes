# Naval Commander

| Naval Commander Hat | Naval Commander Short Hair | Naval Commander Eyepatch |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| A fine, feathered hat - at least until some disrespectful pirate tries to shoot it off your head. | A neat and tidy haircut that practically radiates authority. | A royal red patch adorned with gold. You'll want to keep taking it off just so you can stare at it. |

| Naval Commander Hook | Naval Commander Pegleg | Naval Commander Jacket |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| A sturdy hook, but don't let others get the impression you're a good-for-nothing privateer. | Bringing rule and order to the lawless seas can sometimes cost you life and limb. | Designed by royal tailors to resemble soldiers' armour while proudly displaying a naval insignia. |

| Naval Commander Trousers | Naval Commander Long Hair | Naval Commander Beard |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Loose-fitting trousers are helpful in a scuffle - not that you'd ever lower yourself to such behaviour. | Not exactly a regulation cut, but there's no arguing with style. | Something to stroke pensively as you study the maps of your latest seafaring campaigns. |

| Naval Commander Shirt | Naval Commander Dress | Naval Commander Belt |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| Such exquisite needlework! Such style! Such flair! Try not to get grog all over it. | There's no rule that says you can't look elegant while you're scuttling every last pirate on the waves. | This belt is covered in so many gems, pickpockets may try to steal it rather than your purse. |

| Naval Commander Gloves | Naval Commander Boots |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Wear these at all times - it would never do for an officer to get their hands dirty. | Wearing these, you can stamp out the pirate scourge once and for all! Metaphorically, at least. |
