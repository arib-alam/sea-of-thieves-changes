# Mercenary

| Mercenary Cutlass | Mercenary Belt | Mercenary Flag |
| ----------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| A blade that's certainly more trustworthy than you are, sellsword. | A famed crew of mercenaries melted down their first gold payment into these commemorative buckles. | A flag with a sting, showing that you're available for a contract... or about to complete one. |

| Mercenary Capstan | Mercenary Banjo | Mercenary Shovel |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| A steel anchor weighs heavy on this capstan, yet nothing weighs on your conscience. | Banjo playing hardens the fingers, just as mercenary work hardens the soul. | Digging feels like less work when you remember that the treasure belongs to someone else. |

| Mercenary Trousers | Mercenary Figurehead | Mercenary Tankard |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------- |
| Even more reluctantly taken as part payment from the same impoverished and barefooted client. | Fast, deadly and downright mean; this imposing scorpion announces your coming perfectly. | Fighting for gold is a lot of hard work; use some of that gold to fill this tankard. |

| Mercenary Fishing Rod | Mercenary Eye of Reach | Mercenary Gloves |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| For the right price, you'd even catch a poor, defenceless fish. Have you no heart?! | For those contracts that require a little more finesse, or ideally, not taking any risk at all. | Gives the kind of bone-crunching handshake that ensures prompt payment from anyone who hires you. |

| Mercenary Pistol | Mercenary Jacket | Mercenary Lantern |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Grabbin' Garner, king of the mercenaries, was known to fire solid gold shot from one of these. | Its deep hidden pockets come in handy to pick up a little extra unscrupulous gold while on a job. | Let's face it; you do your best work at night, so this lantern will prove useful. |

| Mercenary Speaking Trumpet | Mercenary Wheel | Mercenary Spyglass |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Makes it much easier to demand more gold, while you and your hostages stay at a distance. | Nicer than the average wheel, since you earn more than the average pirate. By shooting them. | Put this to use when hunting down the victim of your latest contract. |

| Mercenary Boots | Mercenary Eyepatch | Mercenary Cannons |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Reluctantly taken as part payment from a destitute client down on their luck. | Reminds everyone that once you make your mark on a contract you see the job through. | Sometimes you're hired to take out a whole crew. That's when these beasts come out to play. |

| Mercenary Hurdy-Gurdy | Mercenary Hull | Mercenary Sails |
| --------------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| The hurdy shows off your softer side, perfect for luring people into a trap... | The proud, colourful hull of a true mercenary; there's no shame in having the will to win. | The scorpion is a fine motif for a mercenary like yourself - you strike hard, fast and once. |

| Mercenary Pocket Watch | Mercenary Pegleg | Mercenary Compass |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| What time is it? Time to get paid, of course. | When a client couldn't pay, their leg was taken away. Now it's yours. | When your greedy nose fails to sniff out a reward, you can rely on this to help point the way. |
