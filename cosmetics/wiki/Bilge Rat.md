# Bilge Rat

| Bilge Rat Fishing Rod | Bilge Rat Cannons | Bilge Rat Figurehead |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| A bendy stick with a distinct aroma of fish. Close enough, right? | A cannon with a crack in the barrel is still perfectly safe. For decorative purposes anyway. | A dirty, ugly fish that dwells unloved where nothing else lives? The ideal pet of any Bilge Rat. |

| Bilge Rat Captain's Table | Bilge Rat Cheer Emote | Bilge Rat Captain's Bed |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| A good-as-new table made from an old, broken table - and some glue. | A little enthusiasm makes everyone's day! Spread some cheer with this friendly gesture. | A mattress stuffed with the finest sawdust for that lovely 'old bed' smell. |

| Bilge Rat Banjo | Cockatoo Bilge Rat Outfit | Bilge Rat Sails |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | --------------- |
| A plucky old banjo, mostly held together with spit and good intentions. | A rugged Outfit for a Cockatoo from the wrong side of the tree. | Be careful how much you raise and lower these, they're getting a bit threadbare and may rip. |

| Bilge Rat Dance Emote | Bilge Rat Clap Emote | Bilge Rat Hat |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| Bilge Rats are known for their love of grog and dancing. There is almost certainly a connection. | Bilge Rats are very keen and supportive, especially if someone just bought a fresh round of grog. | Bitten by parrots and shot through by Skeletons, this hat tells its own tales of woe. |

| Bilge Rat Beard | Bilge Rat Captain's Chair | Bilge Rat Compass |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Contains a voyage's worth of spilt food, now dried and impossible to remove. | Covered in splinters and sharp edges, which is just how you like it. | Did you know you can navigate by the North star? You might need to if you buy this. |

| Alsatian Bilge Rat Outfit | Bilge Rat Lantern | Bilge Rat Speaking Trumpet |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| Does it make your dog look tough or adorable? Why not both? | Don't be too rough with it, or you might find yourself in a bit of a dark place. | Don't remove the leather straps, and don't ask why. |

| Mau Bilge Rat Outfit | Bilge Rat Belt | Bilge Rat Captain's Drapes |
| -------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Dressing a cat as a Bilge Rat? Surely that's just mean. | Easily adjustable by simply tying on a bit more rope. | Fashioned from a set of old bedsheets. Waste not, want not! |

| Bilge Rat Hook | Bilge Rat Boots | Bilge Rat Cutlass |
| -------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| Fashioned from the oarlock of an old rowing boat found abandoned in the Wilds. | For those that like to feel the deck beneath their feet and the sand between their toes. | Full of notches, but it's still got plenty of space to collect lots more. |

| Inu Bilge Rat Outfit | Parakeet Bilge Rat Outfit | Bilge Rat Wheel |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------- |
| Give your Inu a rough-and-tumble look to put some edges on all that fluff. | Give your Parakeet a tough look with a rope, that’s sure to get a serious chewing. | Held together by many bodged repairs, this wheel may not always turn (and may not always stop). |

| Bilge Rat Pocket Watch | Bilge Rat Hull | Bilge Rat Spyglass |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| If it stops working, just bash it against a rock. Everybody else has. | It's been crashed and repaired so many times we're not sure if any of the original paint remains. | Its lens fell out years ago, but luckily a new one's been made from the bottom of a rum bottle. |

| Bilge Rat Sleep Emote | Bilge Rat Shirt | Bilge Rat Drum |
| --------------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| Let's be honest - pirates like you just sleep wherever they drop. | Made from the sails of shipwrecks, after a while you'll forget about the slightly odd smell. | Not sure this can still be called a drum but it's an interesting conversation piece that sounds like a drum. |

| Ragamuffin Bilge Rat Outfit | Bilge Rat Tankard | Bilge Rat Blunderbuss |
| --------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Now that's a rough-and-ready Ragamuffin out for an adventure! | Once drank from by Captain Bones. And his father. And his grandfather before that. | Once prone to barrel explosions after overfilling with shot. Should be OK now though. |
| [![Ragamuffin Bilge Rat Outfit image thumbnail](https://seaofthieves.wiki.gg/images/c/c0/Ragamuffin_Bilge_Rat_Outfit.png)](https://seaofthieves.wiki.gg/wiki/Ragamuffin_Bilge_Rat_Outfit) | [![Bilge Rat Tankard image thumbnail](https://seaofthieves.wiki.gg/images/1/1b/Bilge_Rat_Tankard.png)](https://seaofthieves.wiki.gg/wiki/Bilge_Rat_Tankard) | [![Bilge Rat Blunderbuss image thumbnail](https://seaofthieves.wiki.gg/images/5/50/Bilge_Rat_Blunderbuss.png)](https://seaofthieves.wiki.gg/wiki/Bilge_Rat_Blunderbuss) |

| Bilge Rat Eyepatch | Bilge Rat Jacket | Bilge Rat Bucket |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Once worn by legendary pirates. Not as an eyepatch though, but as their underwear. | One careful owner, followed by several careless ones. | Previously used as a slop bucket by a crew who ate nothing but rotten bananas. |

| Bilge Rat Pegleg | Bilge Rat Trousers | Bilge Rat Eye of Reach |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Rather than light a campfire with this rotten driftwood, we made it into a leg instead. | Rats were nesting in these, but after a quick wipe over you'd hardly tell. | Requires the steadiest of hands. Not for ensuring a hit, but to prevent this rifle falling apart. |

| Bilge Rat Captain's Rugs | Bilge Rat Hurdy-Gurdy | Macaw Bilge Rat Outfit |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Sticky and a little threadbare, but there's still life in this old rug. Weevils, mostly. | Suffered a few minor scrapes after a lively shanty session in the tavern at Golden Sands outpost. | The eyepatch helps your Macaw fit in with a pirate crew - in fact it might end up being captain! |

| Bilge Rat Concertina | Bilge Rat Captain's Curtains | Bilge Rat Weapon 1 Pose Emote |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| The handles fell off long ago, but nothing a bit of rope and some nails haven't fixed. | The hem of these curtains has been meticulously frayed for that Bilge Rat aesthetic. | The weapon you have equipped will determine which confident, combative pose you strike. |

| Bilge Rat Weapon 2 Pose Emote | Bilge Rat Hair | Bilge Rat Capstan |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| The weapon you have equipped will determine which confident, combative pose you strike. | There's far more important things in a pirate's life than cutting your hair. | This capstan is sturdier than it looks, but the splinters are a nightmare. |

| Bilge Rat Captain's Chandelier | Bilge Rat Pistol | Capuchin Bilge Rat Outfit |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| This is a great chandelier, now that the shine's worn off. | This previously owned pistol comes with a two hour or two shot guarantee, whichever occurs first. | This rough-and-ready little waistcoat will make your Capuchin feel like a true pirate. |

| Whippet Bilge Rat Outfit | Bilge Rat Sit Emote | Wildcat Bilge Rat Outfit |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| This rugged outfit will help your Whippet race into the action with confidence. | True lazing around is an art form that you've perfected. | What, your Wildcat doesn't look enough like a loveable scruff? This outfit can fix that. |

| Bilge Rat Dress | Bilge Rat Point Emote | Barbary Bilge Rat Outfit |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| When ‘Two Hooks Tom' lost both hands to a shark, he decided to make dresses instead. | When you're this drunk, it's hard to point at just one thing at a time. | With this perfectly piratey Bilge Rat Outfit, your Barbary will be terrifying merchants in no time. |

| Bilge Rat Shovel | Bilge Rat Gloves | Bilge Rat Wave Emote |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| Would you believe that's still the original handle? Lots of digging left in it yet. | Years of not-so-honest hard work has worn away these once pristine gloves. | You can tell this is a Bilge Rat wave by the slightly drunk wobble. |
