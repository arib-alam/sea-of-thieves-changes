# Cursed Bone

| Beard of Cursed Bone | Pegleg of Cursed Bone | Scar of Cursed Bone |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| A bushy beard styled after a certain Skeleton Lord, for those who seek to flatter through imitation. | A fake bone leg crafted for those who enjoy tibia tricks and fibbing about fibulas. | A remant of an old injury that cut right down to the bone, and then some. |

| Makeup of Cursed Bone | Eyepatch of Cursed Bone | Gloves of Cursed Bone |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| A skeletal makeover for those pirates who wish every day could be the Festival of the Damned. | An oversized eyepatch that makes use of a gemstone to help communicate the whole 'evil incarnate' aesthetic. | Give a whole new meaning to the phrase 'bony wrists'. |

| Tattoo of Cursed Bone | Hat of Cursed Bone | Lengthy Hair of Cursed Bone |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Inked ribs and vertebrae by an artist with a particular penchant for osteology. | Liberating the waves from the scourge of the Companies? Now that would be a feather in your cap. | Lustrous locks that prove you can have really good hair while still being a really evil pirate. |

| Hook of Cursed Bone | Lick-Back Hair of Cursed Bone | Boots of Cursed Bone |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Nothing is more important than serving the Flame - not even life and limb. | Some kind of demonic horn? No, that's just hair. You'll have to show your evil in other ways. | Sturdy enough for you to grind the decadent Trading Companies under your heel! |

| Dress of Cursed Bone | Sails of Cursed Bone | Jacket of Cursed Bone |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Stylish and scorch-proof, this elegant ensemble will last you through any firefight. | The Hourglass of Fate reminds all those who spy it that the time has come to pick a side. | The sharp, golden bones certainly make a statement, but also make it tricky to dress in the dark. |

| Shirt of Cursed Bone | Flag of Cursed Bone | Belt of Cursed Bone |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| This isn't what tailors normally mean by a ribbed shirt, but needs must... | Whatever flag you fly, the sands of time and of fate are churning ceaselessly around you... | You'll never strike fear into the Pirate Lord's allies if your trousers keep falling down. |

| Trousers of Cursed Bone |

| You're not going to fool anyone into thinking you're a skeleton with these, but you can still rob them. |
