# Merchant Ambassador

| Merchant Ambassador Cutlass | Merchant Ambassador Hurdy-Gurdy | Merchant Ambassador Cannons |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| A blade that's smart without being too ostentatious - just as any Merchant should be. | A boisterous instrument that can even drown out the sound of hungry pigs below deck. | A cannon trimmed with so much gold, it may even be worth more than the ship you're trying to sink with it. |

| Merchant Ambassador Pocket Watch | Merchant Ambassador Figurehead | Merchant Ambassador Wheel |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| A critical bit of gear in a successful Merchant's career. Lose it and you're in for a bad time. | A figurehead of a great golden bird that carries the entire globe in its talons. What could this possibly symbolise? | A wheel that practically screams 'pride', 'prosperity' and 'watch out for that rock!' |

| Merchant Ambassador Hull | Merchant Ambassador Blunderbuss | Merchant Ambassador Pistol |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Clean, striking paintwork that catches the eye. Rumour has it that Chief Trader Mollie adapted the design from elsewhere. | Do try and refrain from too much widespread weapon fire - ammunition doesn't come cheaply, you know. | Duels are a waste of time and resources. Sometimes, however, needs must... |

| Merchant Ambassador Bucket | Merchant Ambassador Flag | Merchant Ambassador Shovel |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Embellished with the finest silks traded across the seas, allowing you to extinguish fires with ease and style. | Fly this flag and tell the world - you've got a hold full of pigs and don't care who knows it. | Guaranteed no blisters when you dig deep with this elegantly padded excavator. |

| Merchant Ambassador Tankard | Merchant Ambassador Drum | Merchant Ambassador Speaking Trumpet |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| It's rumoured that Chief Trader Mollie owns one of these, though she'd never be seen quaffing from it in public. | It's wise not to drum too loudly during a Cargo Run. You wouldn't want to risk cracking the rum bottles. | Let everyone know your trading needs and bark your order for all to hear! |

| Merchant Ambassador Concertina | Merchant Ambassador Eye of Reach | Merchant Ambassador Sails |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Not even the jauntiest tune will distract the Merchant Alliance if your delivery arrives later than expected. | Not only is this a fine weapon, you can use it to keep an eye on your cargo from a distance. | Pristine sails fashioned from exotic silks. Useful when ferrying... exotic silks. |

| Merchant Ambassador Banjo | Merchant Ambassador Spyglass | Merchant Ambassador Fishing Rod |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Snakes can be mesmerised by music, which is useful if you've been hired to transport them. | Spot your trading partners, crates and animals easily with this magnificent addition to any Merchant's equipment haul. | The Merchant Alliance once considered fishing to be a spurious waste of time, until they saw how much profit the shipwrights made selling bait to Captains. |

| Merchant Ambassador Capstan | Merchant Ambassador Compass | Merchant Ambassador Lantern |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| The spinning pegs of a capstan are like a ticking clock counting against your cargo. | This intricate instrument may not always guide you to spoils, but it always points true. | Useful for those lonely nights poring over trade routes and delivery plans. |
