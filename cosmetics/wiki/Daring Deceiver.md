# Daring Deceiver

| Daring Deceiver's Dress | Daring Deceiver's Shirt | Daring Deceiver's Beard |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| A many-layered dress with thick folds that are perfect for secreting a weapon or two inside. | A ruffled shirt so fine, you'd never suspect it was really two stolen garment halves stitched together. | A smart moustache with a full beard that has the pleasing side-effect of helping to disguise your true face. |

| Daring Deceiver's Eyepatch | Daring Deceiver's Jacket | Daring Deceiver's Hat |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| If a foe's not paying attention, they might well assume that's an authentic eyepatch you're wearing... | NOTE: Tricks up your sleeves not included. | Pirates who wear form-fitting bandanas can't possibly be keeping secrets under their hat. |

| Daring Deceiver's Disarming Hair | Daring Deceiver's Pegleg | Daring Deceiver's Belt |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Pirates will be so busy admiring your lustrous locks, they'll never see you reaching for a weapon. | Tell an enthralling tale about how you got this pegleg, and you'll distract everyone from vanishing gold pouches. | The most deceitful thing about this belt is that it secretly contains another, slightly smaller belt. |

| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| The perfect hook for the perfect crook. Skilled pirates might even learn to use it as a lockpick. | They say you can read a lot about a pirate from their boots. Prove them wrong! | Well-cut trousers are a key part of any swindler's attire, and come with many secret pockets. |
