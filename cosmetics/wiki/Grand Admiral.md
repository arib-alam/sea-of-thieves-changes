# Grand Admiral

| Grand Admiral Fishing Rod | Grand Admiral Trousers | Grand Admiral Hat |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| A fine fishing rod in the hands of a disciplined user. Do you have a license for it? | A fine pair of immaculately pressed breeches that are nearly as uptight as you are. | A hat makes the pirate, so look no further than this distinguished but impractical headwear. |

| Grand Admiral Pistol | Grand Admiral Capstan | Grand Admiral Pegleg |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| A noble weapon that will serve you admirably, so long as you remember to load it. | A tidy, sturdy capstan that you'd find on a nice, proper vessel. | A wooden leg doesn't lessen your duty. It's no excuse for getting stuck in the deck grille though. |

| Grand Admiral Sails | Grand Admiral Boots | Grand Admiral Dress |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| At the wheel it's a stirring sight. Don't get too distracted, or you'll see the bottom of the sea. | Boots so shiny you can see your face in them, but no promises you'll like what you see. | Both practical and formal, in the highly unlikely chance of attending a society ball on the seas. |

| Grand Admiral Eye of Reach | Grand Admiral Hook | Grand Admiral Shirt |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Do your duty and don't buy this, as there is no honor in fighting from range. | Don't wipe sea spray from your eyes or you'll be wearing an eyepatch too. | Extra starch ensures you'll stay smart in the roughest of storms. Smarter pirates avoid them though. |
