| Royal Revenge Cutlass | Royal Revenge Pistol | Collector's Royal Revenge Figurehead |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| A sword inspired by legends of a lost undersea city, passed down from pirate to pirate. | A weapon said to have been owned by a particularly cruel, not to mention hirsute, pirate captain. | An infernal energy shines forth from this skeletal figurehead, sowing dread in all who spy its glow on the horizon. |

| Royal Revenge Cannon Flare | Royal Revenge Wheel | Royal Revenge Eye of Reach |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Crimson and gold are often thought of as bright, cheerful colours - ideal hues for blinding crews to your true intentions. | Flanked by twin braziers and adorned with a horned skull, the helm is yours - if you're brave enough to take the wheel. | Instil dread in your foes by picking them off before they ever see your face. |

| Royal Revenge Hull | Royal Revenge Flag | Royal Revenge Capstan |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Regal paintwork inspired by stories of a ship whose captain could turn its ropes and mooring against those who displeased him. | Ships that spot this flag on the horizon have a habit of turning tail to flee. Not that it helps… | The crew for another pair of hands to help with the capstan. This probably wasn’t what they had in mind. |

| Royal Revenge Cannons | Royal Revenge Sails | Collector's Royal Revenge Sails |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| The sundered skulls wrapped around these cannons bring new meaning to shooting one’s mouth off. | These sails have been faded by the sun thanks to long years at sea, and have witnessed many wicked deeds. | These sails have been restored to their former glory and now gleam as you sail. Try to avoid being lashed to the mast. |

| Mutinous Mutt | Royal Revenge Figurehead | Royal Revenge Blunderbuss |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| This dapper dog may seem trustworthy, but is best watched closely if you have cursed gold aboard your ship. | This skeleton holds a spear in one hand and a goblet in the other - a toast, to those who are about to fall in battle. | You're not the kind of pirate who needs tricks to inspire fear, only this might blunderbuss. |
