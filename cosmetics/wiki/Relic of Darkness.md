# Relic of Darkness

| Relic of Darkness Cutlass | Relic of Darkness Lantern | Relic of Darkness Figurehead |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| A blade that's been slightly weathered from striking skeletons. Many, many skeletons... | A darkness lantern is a thing of beauty and confusion. | A strange, patchwork approximation of an Order of Souls representative. The glowing eyes make it seem oddly lifelike... |

| Relic of Darkness Cannons | Relic of Darkness Shovel | Relic of Darkness Bucket |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Being shrouded in swathes of the Order's signature purple cloth makes these cannons seem almost mysterious. | Bury bones or bring to light bright bounties with this tool from the Order of Souls. | Carefully crafted by the Order of Souls to ensure no evil spirits can affect its contents. |

| Relic of Darkness Fishing Rod | Relic of Darkness Pistol | Relic of Darkness Blunderbuss |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Created by an easily distracted weaponsmith who thought she was working with the Order of Shoals. | Created by the Order to shatter skeletons, but it works just as well against any other foe. | Frees skeletons from the bane of their undead existence, whether they like it or not. |

| Relic of Darkness Speaking Trumpet | Relic of Darkness Hurdy-Gurdy | Relic of Darkness Spyglass |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Is there anybody there? Find out with this hailer of the spirit world! | It is said that during the Festival of the Damned, this hurdy-gurdy has been known to wind itself... | It won't help you see into the souls of pirates, but it can spot a skeleton on a beach or a skull in the water... |

| Relic of Darkness Pocket Watch | Relic of Darkness Drum | Relic of Darkness Sails |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Keep an eye on the time, the Order tell their representatives. Good at prophecy, bad at comedy. | Madame Olivia claims that music can soothe the soul - coming from her, that may not be a figure of speech... | Madame Olivia prophesies a profitable journey for any ship adorned with these sails. |

| Relic of Darkness Capstan | Relic of Darkness Eye of Reach | Relic of Darkness Concertina |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Mystical foresight won't help you raise the anchor, only old-fashioned brute force. | Peace, tranquility and a calm mind are needed to land shots with this weapon. Oh, and bullets. | Plays many shanties, including Madame Olivia's favourite, 'Seek the Dead'. |

| Relic of Darkness Banjo | Relic of Darkness Compass | Relic of Darkness Flag |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Prove your prophetic prowess by striking up a tune that won't be composed until tomorrow. | South for skulls or East for the esoteric, West for the weird and North for the nocturnal. | Spy this flag on the horizon and it's hard not to imagine that it's staring back... |

| Relic of Darkness Hull | Relic of Darkness Tankard | Relic of Darkness Wheel |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| The patterns on this hull evoke memories of certain ritualistic objects that are highly prized by the Order of Souls. | This tankard carries a vision of the future... More grog! | While you're watching the horizon, try not to worry that the eye on this wheel might be watching you... |
