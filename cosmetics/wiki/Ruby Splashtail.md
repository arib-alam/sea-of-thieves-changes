# Ruby Splashtail

| Splash Dance Emote | Collector's Ruby Splashtail Sails | Ruby Splashtail Sails |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| No description | Go the extra mile for the Splashtail, since they go the extra mile to end up on your stove. | Honour the Splashtail with sails that depict the piscine pal that pirates love to hate. |

| Ruby Splashtail Cannons | Ruby Splashtail Cannon Flare | Ruby Splashtail Figurehead |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Hopefully as accurate as Ruby Splashtails are when they dive onto your hook for the tenth time. | May this cannon flare make your shots have the same fate of most Splashtails - to end up in a pirate's gob. | May your ship leap from the water like a Splashtail onto a frustrated pirate's fishing hook! |

| Ruby Splashtail Wheel | Ruby Splashtail Capstan | Collector's Ruby Splashtail Figurehead |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Mount a Ruby Splashtail on your wheel and you'll be reminded that perseverance is important. | Pirates push their capstans harder when forced to look at yet another Splashtail. | The figurehead of a natural angler with a love of fish, fishing and even this regal Ruby nuisance. |

| Ruby Splashtail Flag | Ruby Splashtail Hull | Ruby Splashtail Monarch Costume |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| The most common fish of these waters. Thankfully, they are not currently aggressive or organised... | The Ruby Splashtail gets its name from being red and having a splashy tail. Pirates are direct folk. | The Splashtail Monarch in folklore provides bounty from the sea... and maybe the occasional nightmare. |

| Ruby Splashtail Fishing Rod |
| --------------------------- |
| This rod honours the Splashtail, many a proud pirate's first catch. And second. And third... |
