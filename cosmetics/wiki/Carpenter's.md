# Carpenter's

| Carpenter's Blunderbuss | Carpenter's Eye of Reach | Carpenter's Pistol |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| An ornate fusion of land and sea that most foes won't have long enough to appreciate. | Channel the steadiness of an oak tree to line up that perfect long-range shot. | The smooth, tide-polished surface of driftwood makes for a surprisingly comfortable grip. |

| Carpenter's Cutlass |
| ------------------- |
| What better carving to guard your hand than the unbreakable shell of a turtle? |
