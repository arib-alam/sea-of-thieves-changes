# Tribute Peak

| Tribute Peak Hull | Tribute Peak Fishing Rod | Tribute Peak Figurehead |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| A design that, it is said, was once used by the Gold Hoarders' ships when transporting their riches to the Shores of Gold. | A fishing rod makes an excellent tool for any Gold Hoarder who refuses to pay for their next meal. | A golden icon that shares certain similarities with a notorious Skeleton Lord. A bold, golden choice for any crew. |

| Tribute Peak Cutlass | Tribute Peak Eye of Reach | Tribute Peak Bucket |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| A stunning blade created by dipping an emerald shard into a crucible filled with molten gold. | All that glints is not gold - it might will be that some distant foe has you in their sights. | Bail in style with the type of bucket only a very rich pirate would own. |

| Tribute Peak Banjo | Tribute Peak Concertina | Tribute Peak Spyglass |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| Be careful how vigorously you strum this banjo - golden strings are especially expensive to replace. | Even a musical instrument can bring in some gold. Just make sure you charge anyone who hears you play. | Fashioned in Gold Hoarder green and gold, this will help you identify the finest opportunities for further wealth. |
