| Parrot Beard | Parrot Tankard | Parrot Hurdy-Gurdy |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------------ |

| Parrot Hook | Parrot Captain's Rugs | Parrot Rapier |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| A hook as pretty and dangerous as the talons of an angry parrot. | A rug that's every bit as soft as the plumage of our feathered friends. | Adorned with a parrot's beautiful colours to disguise a blade that's sharper than any beak. |

| Parrot Jacket | Parrot Cutlass | Parrot Heavy Sword |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Bright and feathery, this jacket is kind of an insult to poor old Salty. Shame on you! | Colourful Cutlass Carves Curious Corsairs! Is the Pirate Times headline you should be aiming for. | Despite its appearance, 'feather-light' is not a term that has ever been used to describe this weapon. |

| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------ |
| Don't read your Voyages out loud with a parrot around. You never know what it might repeat... | Draping cloth over a pet cage makes parrots fall asleep. Perhaps it also works on pirates? | Exotic pirates prefer to plunder expertly in this expressive parrot plumage! |
