# Ocean Crawler

| Ocean Crawler Dress | Ocean Crawler Compass | Ocean Crawler Bucket |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| A beautiful dress of the crustacean persuasion, if only there was an underwater ball. | A compass crafted from shells... don't drop it in the water or you'll be searching for hours. | A crab bucket, which you could keep crabs in, making it a crab crab bucket. |

| Ocean Crawler Flag | Ocean Crawler Eyepatch | Ocean Crawler Captain's Table |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| A flag fitting for any ship that does not fear the deep. | A rather distinguished way to say that there's no part of the ocean you won't explore. | A rather weathered piece of furniture that's spent time both above and below the waves. |

| Ocean Crawler Figurehead | Ocean Crawler Flintlock Pistol | Ocean Crawler Beard |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| A true ocean-going figurehead that will appease the denizens of the deep. | After being hit by this pistol, the enemy will feel decidedly shell-shocked. | Are you even a pirate if you don't have a few barnacles in your beard? |

| Ocean Crawler Hull | Ocean Crawler Tankard | Ocean Crawler Cutlass |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Decorate your own shell with something beautifully crustacean. | Drink enough from this crabby tankard and you'll soon walk sideways. | Give your enemies a taste of a biting claw, just like a human fiddler crab! |

| Ocean Crawler Cannons | Ocean Crawler Boots | Ocean Crawler Gloves |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Inspired by things that crawl and snap in the deep, these cannons will put the pinch on the enemy. | Let's hope these crab boots don't make you walk sideways. | Make sure you check these gloves for hermit crabs before you put your hands in. |

| Ocean Crawler Speaking Trumpet | Ocean Crawler Captain's Chandelier | Ocean Crawler Wheel |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Make sure your voice is heard far and wide, even down in the depths where the lobsters live. | Named after the humble crab, not to be confused with crews cursed by the Siren Queen. | Not necessarily the most pleasant wheel to the touch, but it seems to know its way around the seas. |

| Ocean Crawler Captain's Chair | Ocean Crawler Eye of Reach | Ocean Crawler Fishing Rod |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Not the most ornate chair ever crafted, but it'll do in a pinch. | Perfect for spotting a nice crab pool, or defending one from hungry pirates. | Perhaps the oceanic style of this rod will act as camouflage and the fishies won't see it coming. |

| Ocean Crawler Captain's Bed | Ocean Crawler Rapier | Ocean Crawler Banjo |
| --------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Pirates who don't get a good night's sleep are bound to wake up feeling crabby. | Razor thin to slip easily between the crack in even the strongest of protective shells. | Resonating through this crusty shell, your shanties will surely call to the creatures of the deep. |

| Ocean Crawler Concertina | Ocean Crawler Lantern | Ocean Crawler Heavy Sword |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Share a tune on your crustacean concertina and get even the land-lubbers dancing. | Some crabs are attracted to light, but they'll think twice if they see what your lantern's made of. | Some Sea of Thieves crustaceans have been getting a little large in recent years, so pick up a weapon to match. |

| Ocean Crawler Jacket | Ocean Crawler Spyglass | Ocean Crawler Pocket Watch |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| This jacket is colourfully crabby, perfect for exotic explorers. | This shelly spyglass could be useful for spotting giant enemy crabs. Purely theoretical, sadly. | This watch says it's always time for seafood! |
