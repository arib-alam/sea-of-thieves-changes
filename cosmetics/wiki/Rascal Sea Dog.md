# Rascal Sea Dog

| Rascal Sea Dog Banjo | Rascal Sea Dog Spyglass | Rascal Sea Dog Concertina |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| A banjo for the salt of the earth - sturdy, simple and tuned to perfection. | Allows you to get a close-up of the terror in your rival's eyes. | Bilge Rat Beanland played the very first shanty ever heard on one of these. |

| Rascal Sea Dog Lantern | Rascal Sea Dog Shovel | Rascal Sea Dog Fishing Rod |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Built to last, a heavy-duty lantern that won't go out even when dropped from the crow's nest. | Certified to have dug up at least a hundred chests, it's a shovel you can rely on. | From Sailor's Bounty to Ashen Reaches, a stalwart rod like this can keep a pirate well-fed. |

| Rascal Sea Dog Speaking Trumpet | Rascal Sea Dog Pocket Watch | Rascal Sea Dog Pistol |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Hundreds of orders have been barked through this speaking trumpet, and hundreds more ignored. | It's been bitten by a shark and swallowed by a Kraken, yet it still works! | Its design has remained stubbornly unchanged since the first pirate sailed into the Sea of Thieves. |

| Rascal Sea Dog Compass | Rascal Sea Dog Hurdy-Gurdy | Rascal Sea Dog Bucket |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| No-one had ever sailed east until the buccaneering forefathers invented this. | Part-time pirates will have absolutely no idea what this is. You'll know better, of course. | Previously used as a slop bucket by a crew who ate nothing but rotten bananas. |

| Rascal Sea Dog Drum | Rascal Sea Dog Eye of Reach | Rascal Sea Dog Tankard |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| This can't help you play better but it also can't help you play worse. Win win. | When Blind Bob was not quite so blind, he added his spyglass to a musket and created this. | When your ship goes down, what's the first thing a true pirate should save from a watery grave? |
