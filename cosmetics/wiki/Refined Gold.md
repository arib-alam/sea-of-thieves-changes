# Refined Gold

| Refined Gold Spyglass | Refined Gold Speaking Trumpet | Refined Gold Cutlass |

| Carrying around a spyglass as shiny as this one on the Sea of Thieves is just asking to have your pocket picked. | Everything automatically sounds more important when it's said through a solid gold speaking trumpet. | The shiny gold hilt might make this cutlass look like a fashion statement, but the blade is no less sharp. |
