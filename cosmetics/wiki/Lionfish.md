# Lionfish

| Courtly Dance Emote | Collector's Lionfish Sails | Lionfish Pistol |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------- |
| No description | Adorned with the golden visage of a lionfish, the approach of these sails should hurry you to roll out the red carpet. | Don't be bamboozled by this kaleidoscopic pistol - you'll be seeing black if you end up on the wrong end of it. |

| Lionfish Flag | Lionfish Capstan | Lionfish Hurdy-Gurdy |
| ------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| Don't be fooled by the sweet words of crews sporting this regal but venomous flag. They'll twist the knife at a moment's notice. | Elbows in when turning this elegant capstan - we can't guarantee those barbs aren't venomous. | Expect some psychedelic jams when you're rocking out with this harlequin hurdy-gurdy. Groovy. |

| Lionfish Sails | Lionfish Eye of Reach | Collector's Lionfish Figurehead |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Gold, red, blue AND purple: someone spent a pretty penny on dye to make these majestic sails. | If all else fails, blind your opponent with this weapon's dazzling array of colours. Who needs stealth? | If you listen closely, you can hear the relaxing sound of this gold-trimmed figurehead: blupblupblupblupblupblup. |

| Lionfish Blunderbuss | Lionfish Hull | Lionfish Cannons |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Like the fish it's modelled on, this multicoloured blunderbuss looks harmless but packs a mighty wallop. | Like the lionfish leaping out of the waves on its side, may this hull see you gliding gracefully over the ocean. | Rather than having the lionfish spit out cannonballs, the jester who designed these cannons made them fire from the other end. |

| Lionfish Cutlass | Lionfish Wheel | Lionfish Figurehead |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| While this cutlass' spines may not be venomous, getting poked with one doesn't half sting. | With its bladed edge, this opulent wheel doubles as a buzzsaw if spun fast enough. Make sure your anchor's down first though. | With its mouth agape, the bright red figurehead has been known to scoop up fish when sailing through choppy waters. That's your dinner sorted. |
