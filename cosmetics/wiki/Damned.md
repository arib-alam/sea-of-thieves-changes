# Damned

| Ferry of the Damned Figurehead | Cutlass of the Damned | Blunderbuss of the Damned |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| A haunting figurehead depicting a hippocampus, a mythical sea-creature who helped lost souls... | A pirate who seriously mistimed their sword lunge took this weapon with them to the Ferry, and left it there. | A powerful weapon that's sure to keep the Ferryman busy with new arrivals. |

| Spyglass of the Damned | Beard of the Damned | Tankard of the Damned |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| A spectral spyglass that'll help you see dead people. Also, living people. | A strong beard that will give you courage, should the Ferryman ever catch you impersonating him. | A tankard plundered from an ethereal establishment where, they say, fallen heroes meet to relive their greatest adventures. |

| Eye of Reach of the Damned | Hurdy-Gurdy of the Damned | Concertina of the Damned |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Don't worry about how it's even possible to wield this ghostly gun - concentrate on aiming! | Even in the Sea of the Damned, an instrument like this can liven up a gloomy evening with the power of music. | If you hear a wheezing, creaking sound in the dead of night, it's probably just a ghost practicing on a concertina like this one. |

| Facepaint of the Damned | Lantern of the Damned | Hair of the Damned |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| Take on the haunted, withered look of a pirate who is truly beyond salvation. | This lantern has lit the way through the darkness of the grave and beyond. | This wild hair is the result of seeing things that no mortal should see. |

| Pistol of the Damned | Jacket of the Damned | Banjo of the Damned |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Weapons are generally forbidden aboard the Ferry, so this pistol is practically unused. Until now... | Wear the tattered jacket of the Ferryman himself, to shrug off the chill of death. | Wherever the dead gather and memories of glory are celebrated... Sooner or later, someone's going to start a sing-song. |

| Drum of the Damned | Eyepatch of the Damned | Rapier of the Damned |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| You don't have to be a ghost to create a stirring rhythm with a dead pirate's drum. Use it to honour their adventures! | You'd have an eyepatch as robust as this too, if you had to stare into the Sea of the Damned. | You're not actually supposed to take skulls from the Ferry of the Damned, you know. |
