# Guardian Ghost

| Guardian Ghost Compass | Guardian Ghost Flag | Guardian Ghost Pocket Watch |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| A cold comfort to the wandering dead, lost between worlds. | A flag emblazoned with the Hourglass of Fate - but if you're flying it, you know all about that... | A ghostly watch, ticking away the moments of your life. What happens if it stops? |

| Guardian Ghost Hull | Guardian Ghost Hook | Guardian Ghost Bucket |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| A simple dagger is depicted on this hull, ready to be plunged into the War Map... | Anyone who believes ghosts aren't real will get a ghastly shock when you grab them with this. | Apparently, this bucket had unfinished business in life. |

| Guardian Ghost Trousers | Guardian Ghost Belt | Guardian Ghost Cutlass |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Beware! The haunted pockets on these might make gold vanish, or that might be due to their scary cost. | Effortlessly holds up the heaviest of trouser with an eerily unexplained supernatural force. | Fear not; though ethereal, this cutlass blocks and bites as truly as any earthly steel. |

| Guardian Ghost Hat | Guardian Ghost Jacket | Guardian Ghost Pegleg |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Filled with the thoughts of long-dead pirates. Let's hope they've got something useful to say. | Full-on fearful fashion ensures you'll always cut a spectral dash through any crowded tavern. | Ghosts are well known for their disembodied heads, but have you ever seen a disembodied peg leg? |

| Guardian Ghost Eyepatch | Guardian Ghost Banjo | Guardian Ghost Hurdy-Gurdy |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Gives even the most timid of pirates the power to gaze upon their rivals with a fearful stare. | Gone but not forgotten, banjo fans can play this for all eternity. | If you want to play a haunting melody, start with a haunted instrument! |

| Guardian Ghost Shovel | Guardian Ghost Pistol | Guardian Ghost Wheel |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| Now here's a shovel that has dug more graves than it has dug up treasures. | Pull the trigger to make more ghosts. | Rumour has it that this wheel was used to torture a pirate... by steering him to a grogless tavern. |

| Guardian Ghost Sails | Guardian Ghost Eye of Reach | Guardian Ghost Boots |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Servants who spot the Hourglass of Fate on the horizon will know that their time is running out. | Some ghosts cause destruction without even being seen. This is no exception. | Some say they have seen these bewitched boots walk by themselves when their owner is asleep. |

| Guardian Ghost Lantern | Guardian Ghost Drum | Guardian Ghost Tankard |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Stand on a distant, foggy cliff with this haunting lantern held high and start a few ghost stories | The beats of this drum echo in ways that some find most unsettling... like ghostly heartbeats. | The ghost of a tankard that was smashed over Duke's head in a bar fight. Don't worry, it was empty! |

| Guardian Ghost Cannon | Guardian Ghost Spyglass | Guardian Ghost Concertina |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| These cannons may look ghostly, but the huge balls of iron they fire are very, very corporeal. | They say this spyglass lets you see the dead. Not true. When you look into it, the dead can see you. | This belonged to Captain Graymarrow himself and was the only wholesome hobby he ever had in life. |

| Guardian Ghost Capstan | Guardian Ghost Blunderbuss | Guardian Ghost Fishing Rod |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| This spooky capstan looks like it could raise the dead as well as the anchor! | Though this weapon is almost transparent, it fires very solid, very real buckshot. | You'd think it would scare away the fish. |
