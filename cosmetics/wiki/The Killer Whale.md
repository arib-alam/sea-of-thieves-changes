# The Killer Whale

| The Killer Whale Flag | The Killer Whale Lantern | The Killer Whale Capstan |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| A flag adorned with waves, creating a peaceful nautical image, until the storm hits. | A lantern from The Killer Whale, a ship that never got lost. Eaten, yes, but not lost. | Based on the capstan that went down with The Killer Whale, let's hope this one is luckier. |

| The Killer Whale Figurehead | The Killer Whale Fishing Rod | The Killer Whale Tankard |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Based on the swordfish that adorned The Killer Whale, before Merrick... misplaced the ship. | Merrick himself prefers this quality rod... but his history with sea life isn't very encouraging. | Merrick used a tankard like this on his ship, except his was almost completely eroded by grog. |

| The Killer Whale Cannons | The Killer Whale Sails | The Killer Whale Wheel |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Perfect cannons for taking down sea monsters. They're raring to get some revenge! | The Killer Whale bore these sea-monster sails, a move commonly known as 'tempting fate'. | The last ship to use this beautiful sea-themed wheel was very nimble. Right 'til the end... |
