| Wicked Web Hat | Wicked Web Beard | Wicked Web Hook |
| -------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| A hardy, wide-brimmed hat that makes for an ideal home - if you're a spider, that is. | A high-maintenance beard into which an intricate, web-like design has been carefully shaved. | A peculiar hook that rather resembles the leg of a skulking spider. People may not want to shake it. |

| Wicked Web Shirt | Wicked Web Belt | Wicked Web Gloves |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| A thin silk shirt that can charitably be described as lightweight and breathable. Where's the rest of it? | A very sturdy belt guaranteed to keep your trousers in place, along with anything else it touches. | Aspiring pickpockets need look no further than these gloves, as they bestow extremely sticky fingers. |

| Wicked Web Trousers | Wicked Web Bunched Hair | Wicked Web Blunderbuss |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Despite their appearance, these trousers have just two legs and so were clearly designed with humans in mind. | Having your hair tied back neatly like this helps to avoid getting it caught in cobwebs. | If this is pointed at you, you have a lot more to fear than lurking spiders. |

| Wicked Web Dress | Wicked Web Boots | Wicked Web Collector's Figurehead |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Plenty of dresses are made from spun silk, but this one may be taking things slightly too far. | Send spiders scurrying for the shadows as you stomp around your ship in these heavy boots. | Spiders using glittering gems to lure pirates into their web? That's basically cheating. |

| Wicked Web Cannons | Wicked Web Jacket | Wicked Web Swept Hair |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Standing next to one of these when it's fired will certainly blow away the cobwebs. | The perfect piece of clothing for pirates who frequently find themselves in sticky situations. | The rest of your outfit may be coated in cobwebs, but at least your hair is immaculate. |

| Wicked Web Pegleg | Wicked Web Tankard | Wicked Web Figurehead |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| This gossamer-shrouded pegleg is the last remaining example of an eight-piece set. | This is one very stylish way to keep annoying flies away from your grog. | Useful shipboard residents or creepy, unwanted guests? You and your crew can decide. |

| Wicked Web Eyepatch |
| ------------------- |
| Wearing this highly adhesive eyepatch is easy. Taking it off again is another matter. |
