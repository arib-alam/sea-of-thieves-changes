| A generous choice of hairstyle, making other pirates lucky to lay eyes upon your wonderfully well-tended locks. | A simple linen shirt that comes complete with a pocket for holding your favourite pack of cards. | A six-sided die braided into your facial hair for luck? There are stranger customs, but admittedly not that many. |

| Lucky Hand Pegleg | Lucky Hand Pistol | Lucky Hand Trousers |

| A stout wooden leg that you could probably use to hide a card or two, but that would be cheating... | A useful line of defence to have at hand whenever someone notices the cards hidden up your sleeve. | Diamond-shaped kneepads provide extra protection against wear and tear, for pirates who don't like taking chances. |
