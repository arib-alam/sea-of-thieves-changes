| Adding a new feather to your cap isn't usually so literal but pirates are nothing if not straightforward. | Feather-lined gloves are a level of comfort so rarely enjoyed in the pirate life. | Few birds are known for their sure-footedness, making them a slightly odd choice of inspiration for a pegleg. |

| Make all your avian friends jealous with a hook sharper than any beak. | Most birds use their talons to catch prey. Yours are mostly to help you cling to the rigging. | Someone once said that wearing feathers would make you light-footed. They were wrong, but at least it's colourful. |

| When a strong sea breeze ruffles the feathers, you'd almost believe you could fly. | Who knows what manner of creature supplied such stunning plumage? | You only need one stone on your travels, after all. You know the saying. |
