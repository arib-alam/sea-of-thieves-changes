# Blackcoat Executive Admiral

| Blackcoat Executive Admiral Trousers | Blackcoat Executive Admiral Hat | Blackcoat Executive Admiral Pegleg |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| A fine pair of immaculately pressed breeches that are nearly as uptight as you are. | A hat makes the pirate, so look no further than this distinguished but impractical headwear. | A wooden leg doesn't lessen your duty. It's no excuse for getting stuck in the deck grille though. |

| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Boots so shiny you can see your face in them, but no promises you'll like what you see. | Both practical and formal, in the highly unlikely chance of attending a society ball on the seas. | Don't wipe sea spray from your eyes or you'll be wearing an eyepatch too. |

| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Extra starch ensures you'll stay smart in the roughest of storms. Smarter pirates avoid them though. | Getting your hands dirty is for dishonourable types, so wear these gloves and sniff your innocence. | Promotes an air of undoubted experience in battle, just don't let your crew see it's just for show. |

| The large buckle reflects your stature, but also increases the chance of being struck by lightning. | We'll keep adding silver buttons until everyone's fooled into giving you the desired respect. |
