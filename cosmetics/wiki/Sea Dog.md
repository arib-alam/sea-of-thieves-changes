# Sea Dog

| Sea Dog Banjo | Sea Dog Captain's Rugs | Sea Dog Pegleg |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | -------------- |
| A banjo for the salt of the earth - sturdy, simple and tuned to perfection. | A coarse, thick weave designed to withstand the heavy boots of pirates aboard your ship. | A small accident with a gunpowder barrel and this bit of wood created the legend of Peg Leg Perez. |

| Sea Dog Spyglass | Sea Dog Double Barrel Pistol | Parakeet Sea Dog Outfit |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Allows you to get a close up of the terror in your rival's eyes. | An answer to the question haunting all pirates: what happens if you strap two pistols together? | Bedeck your Parakeet with an eyepatch! It will look fantastic, even when it flies in circles. |

| Sea Dog Concertina | Wildcat Sea Dog Outfit | Sea Dog Lantern |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| Bilge Rat Beanland played the very first shanty ever heard on one of these. | Buckle up, because this smartly dressed Wildcat is a worthy match for any Sea Dog. | Built to last, a heavy duty lantern that won't go out even when dropped from the crow's nest. |

| Sea Dog Wave Emote | Sea Dog Shovel | Sea Dog Captain's Curtains |
| ------------------ | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Catch someone's attention! What happens next depends on the kind of Sea Dog you are... | Certified to have dug up at least a hundred chests, it's a shovel you can rely on. | Curtains that once hung in a disreputable drinking den, until a bar brawl knocked them loose. |

| Sea Dog Trousers | Sea Dog Captain's Drapes | Cockatoo Sea Dog Outfit |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Double stitched. Why risk an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction when bending over to load a cannon? | Drapes fashioned from the roughest, toughest material the Merchants had in stock. | Ensure that your Cockatoo is cock of the walk! |

| Sea Dog Sit Emote | Sea Dog Hook | Sea Dog Fishing Rod |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| Even showing humility, Sea Dogs manage to look a bit fancy. | Forged from old cutlasses discarded by veteran crews. | From Sailor's Bounty to Ashen Reaches, a stalwart rod like this can keep a pirate well-fed. |

| Barbary Sea Dog Outfit | Macaw Sea Dog Outfit | Sea Dog Captain's Bed |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Give your Barbary monkey a rough and ready style, with these tiny Sea Dog trousers. | Give your parrot more panache with a tiny bandana, making it truly part of the crew. | Hardened Sea Dogs prefer to remove the mattress before sleeping in beds like this. |

| Inu Sea Dog Outfit | Sea Dog Point Emote | Sea Dog Speaking Trumpet |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------ |

| Sea Dog Dress | Sea Dog Pocket Watch | Sea Dog Pistol |
| ------------- | -------------------- | -------------- |
| It might look ridiculous on the dancefloor, but it's nearly as good as wearing armour. | It's been bitten by a shark and swallowed by a Kraken. Yet it still works! | Its design has remained stubbornly unchanged since the first pirate sailed into the Sea of Thieves. |

| Sea Dog Captain's Chandelier | Sea Dog Eyepatch | Sea Dog Shirt |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Lights up the room, but sadly you can't swing from this during a fight. | Made from a deck used in a five day game of cards aboard the Ferry of the Damned. | Made from the hammocks that once hung below decks in the renowned galleon, The Black Dog. |

| Sea Dog Hull | Marmoset Sea Dog Outfit | Sea Dog Capstan |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| Made from trees felled by pirate pioneers on Lone Cove. Also full of very old woodworms. | Marmosets may be small, but they can still look like true sailors in this getup. | More travelled than your usual capstan, built to withstand the trials of the Sea of Thieves! |

| Sea Dog Compass | Sea Dog Hat | Sea Dog Hurdy-Gurdy |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| No-one had ever sailed east until the buccaneering forefathers invented this. | Once used by wily scoundrels to hide an extra cannonball, despite the headaches it caused. | Part time pirates will have absolutely no idea what this is. You'll know better, of course. |

| ------------- | -------------- | --------------- |

| Sea Dog Jacket | Sea Dog Sleep Emote | Sea Dog Make Friends Emote |
| -------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Rumour has it that next season's model will even be resistant to lightning strikes. | Sea Dogs get restless legs from the constant urge to show off. | Sea Dogs make friends easily, though not always humbly. |

| Sea Dog Belt | Sea Dog Hair | Sea Dog Figurehead |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------ |
| Ten Gun Tom famously managed to tuck all his pistols in this rugged belt. He couldn't move, though. | The classic long back and sides, favoured by genuine pirates throughout the seas. | The first crew of Sea Dogs battled giant skeletons and made trophies out of their skulls. |

| Sea Dog Flag | Sea Dog Sails | Sea Dog Throwing Knives |
| ------------ | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| The flag of a real pirate. Raise it proudly and don't forget to shake off any old gunpowder! | The most recognised sail on the seas, but only because they've refused to change the dated design. | These are actually just regular knives being repurposed. Don't tell anyone. |

| Sea Dog Cannons | Sea Dog Drum | Sea Dog Captain's Chair |
| --------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| These cannons may be a bit rough around the edges, but they're always ready for battle. | This can't help you play better but it also can't help you play worse. Win win. | This chair's in good condition, as Sea Dogs are almost always off the ship adventuring. |

| Sea Dog Bucket | Whippet Sea Dog Outfit | Sea Dog Eye of Reach |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| To become the scourge of the seas you occasionally need to bail some of it out. | Turn your Whippet into the most sophisticated Sea Dog around. | When Blind Bob was not quite so blind, he added his spyglass to a musket and created this. |
