# Maestro

| Maestro Concertina | Maestro Wheel | Maestro Shirt |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
| Countless tunes have worn down the keys, but it sings just as well as ever. | Designed by an enterprising musician after a few too many distracted collisions while composing their next hit. | Designed to be loose and airy so you don't overheat in the middle of an orchestral crescendo. |

| Maestro Drum | Maestro Hull | Maestro Capstan |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------------- |
| Each beat of the drum echoes with the hundreds of shanties it has played before. | Many a musician has been inspired by the sweet melody of water lapping against this very hull. | Raising the anchor is always a little easier with a pleasant tune to work to. |

| Maestro Flag | Maestro Trousers | Maestro Hat |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ----------- |
| Signal your musical mastery to the world, even when your audience is out of earshot! | The extra padding is a lifesaver when you're balancing your drum on your knee. | The feather doubles as a quill for when you just can't wait to scribble down a melody. |

| Maestro Banjo | Maestro Boots | Maestro Hurdy-Gurdy |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| The feathers once belonged to a songbird whose melody was almost as beautiful as your own. | The golden accents really catch the sun as you tap your foot along to the beat. | The ornate carvings give the instrument perfect acoustic resonance. Or, at least, that's what you tell people. |

| Maestro Jacket | Maestro Sails | Maestro Figurehead |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| The treble clef might be a tad on the nose, but no one has ever accused you of subtlety. | The whistle of the wind never sounds more tuneful than when it's filling your sails out on the sea. | When they said your musical talent precedes you, this probably wasn't what they meant. |

| Maestro Cannons |
| --------------- |
| You could argue that cannons are a type of instrument, right? How hard can naval combat be? |
