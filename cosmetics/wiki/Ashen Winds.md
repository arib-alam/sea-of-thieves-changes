| Ruth's Bane Tattoo | Horatio's Bane Tattoo | Sails of the Ashen Winds |

| A genius weaponsmith, Red Ruth enjoyed experimenting with her powers, but you are no lab rat. | Old Horatio was a malicious veteran soldier, but it seems he'd never faced a foe like you before. | These sails were darkened by the Ashen Winds, but they are just as flammable as you! |

| Chi's Bane Tattoo | Grimm's Bane Tattoo |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Warden Chi gleefully jailed and punished Flameheart's foes, until you showed her true justice. | You defeated Captain Grimm, a keen strategist and no fool in a fight, but maybe a tad overconfident. |
