# Iron Turtle

| Iron Turtle Collector's Figurehead | Iron Turtle Capstan | Iron Turtle Cannons |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| A figurehead so keen to sink its beak into your foes, you'll wonder why you even need your cannons. | A heavy capstan that's not just visually imposing but gives your crew a serious workout. | A sturdy shell is great, but everyone knows the best defence is really a good offence. |

| Iron Turtle Flag | Iron Turtle Wheel | Iron Turtle Eye of Reach |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Admire this proud pennant as it snaps in the wind like a warning. | Don't ask whether armour plating on the wheel is strictly necessary. It's a look and you'e committed to it. | Even if you're not fast enough to chase down your oppenent, you can still strike from afar. |

| Iron Turtle Figurehead | Iron Turtle Blunderbuss | Iron Turtle Jacket |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| If only this shield was strong enough to protect your ship the next time a rock sneaks up on you. | No amount of natural armour is going to be enough to stop one of these at close range. | No shell you can scavenge in the Sea of Thieves will protect you from a bullet, but it does look very intimidating. |

| Iron Turtle Double Barrel Pistol | Iron Turtle Sails | Iron Turtle Pistol |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| One shot to break through your enemy's armour, the second to dish out some damage. | Slow and steady may work for a tortoise, but these sails are attached to something a little speedier. | Something modest can still be mighty. Show your foes the true potential of smaller sidearms. |

| Iron Turtle Hull | Iron Turtle Collector's Sails | Iron Turtle Cutlass |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
| The boards are dusted with tortoiseshell in an attempt to borrow strength from the great sea turtles of legend. | These striking sails offer everyone an excellent opportunity to learn the word 'scute'. | This blade's extra barbs help it to cut through even the toughest defences. |

| Iron Turtle Throwing Knives | Iron Turtle Masked Hat | Iron Turtle Hat |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| Wickedly curved to weave their way through the cracks in any shell. | With no shell to hide in, you'll have to rely on a hat instead to keep your skull defended. Complete with eerie mask. | With no shell to hide in, you'll have to rely on a hat instead to keep your skull defended. Leaves your face unmasked. |
