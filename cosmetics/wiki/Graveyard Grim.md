# Graveyard Grim

| Graveyard Grim Wildcat | Graveyard Grim Whippet | Graveyard Grim Marmoset |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| A little spot of death wasn't about to get in the way of this cat's daily nap in the sun. | Not even an untimely end is going to keep this protective pooch from its master's side. | Rumour has it this simian was barred from the Sea of the Damned for his light-fingered crimes. |

| The ferryman keeps sending this bird back. Maybe he doesn't like its singing. |
