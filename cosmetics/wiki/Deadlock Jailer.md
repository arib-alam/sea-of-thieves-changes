# Deadlock Jailer

| Deadlock Jailer Costume | Deadlock Jailer Sails | Deadlock Jailer Pistol |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| A costume that really takes the idea of a prison of your own making to a whole new level. | A design that says you will decide who has earned the freedom of the seas and who has not. | A weapon crafted from the fragments of a broken cage to ensure you'll never be trapped in one again. |

| Deadlock Jailer Hull | Deadlock Jailer Throwing Knives | Deadlock Jailer Cutlass |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Be careful not to get locked below deck. No one has ever managed to escape from this particular vessel. | Could probably double as a set of lockpicks if the situation gest dire enough | If chains won't hold your enemies, maybe they'll be able to cut them down instead. |

| Deadlock Jailer Double Barrel Pistol | Deadlock Jailer Cannons | Deadlock Jailer Collector's Sails |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| If the first shot isn't enough to secure a surrender, the second one steps up the persuasion. | If you can't imprison your foes, at least you can blow them to bits from afar! | Old tales speak of dangerous figures locked behind iron masks, but you are more than mere myth. |

| Deadlock Jailer Blunderbuss | Deadlock Jailer Trinket | Deadlock Jailer Collector's Figurehead |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| On the rare occasions when you elect to take no prisoners, this blunderbuss proves its worth. | The perfect hiding spot for your small valuables, like gold or the brig keys. Maybe any fancy rocks you find. | The threat of imprisonment is many a pirate's worst nightmare, now brought to life with this ghoulish figure. |

| Deadlock Jailer Figurehead | Deadlock Jailer Wheel | Deadlock Jailer Capstan |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| This doomed pirate's freedom may always be out of their reach, but the horizon's within yours. | When you asked for a helping hand at the wheel, this probably wasn't what you had in mind. | Who knows what pirate crimes could have consigned this poor soul to such a fate? |

| Deadlock Jailer Flag | Deadlock Jailer Eye of Reach |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Why settle for the traditional crossbones motif when you could use a crossed chains design instead? | With this scope and a steady hand, you could put a bullet through a keyhole at a hundred yards. |
