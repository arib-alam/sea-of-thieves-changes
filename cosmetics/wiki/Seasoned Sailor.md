# Seasoned Sailor

| Seasoned Sailor Compass | Seasoned Sailor Blunderbuss | Seasoned Sailor Speaking Trumpet |

| A finely crafted navigational aid. If you're wearing two eyepatches. | Fires a spread of shot just as good as those more interesting-looking blunderbusses. | What's less interesting? How this thing looks? Or the nonsense you'll spout from it? Can't tell. |
