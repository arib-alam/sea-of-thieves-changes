# Magpie's Wing

| Magpie's Wing Flag | Magpie's Wing Wheel | Magpie's Wing Cannons |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| A flag depicting a roaring tiger, and the first to be flown in this age of the Sea of Thieves. | As close as any present-day pirate can get to helming the Pirate Lord's legendary ship. | Cannons from the Magpie's Wing, the Pirate Lord's own ship! Just like him, they're still kicking. |

| Ever the tinkerer, Shan would frequently repaint the Magpie's Wing. This is just one of his designs. | Like the Pirate Lord, this figurehead is cheerful and friendly - but it still has claws. | The Pirate Lord could always be recognised on sight, not least because of these striking sails. |

| Magpie's Wing Capstan |
| --------------------- |
| When the original was damaged by a Kraken, the Pirate Lord ordered this identical replacement. |
