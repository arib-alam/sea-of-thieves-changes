# Wild Rose

| Wild Rose Shovel | Wild Rose Eye of Reach | Wild Rose Hull |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | -------------- |
| A beautiful shovel that pretty much does the ground a favour. | A beautifully crafted weapon; shame your attackers will never get close enough to see it. | A bright red hull with a thorn motif, reminding pirates of that well-known warning about roses. |

| Rose's Compass | Wild Rose Cannons | Wild Rose Banjo |
| -------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| A memento of Wild Rose, whose love for George transcended death itself. | A perfect example of how the deadly and the delicate can meet as one. | A pretty banjo that would be ideal for a little moonlight serenade. |

| Wild Rose Figurehead | Wild Rose Hat | Wild Rose Spyglass |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| A romantic figure, encouraging pirates to seek the good things in life, for the bad things come unbidden. | A rugged but beautiful hat, lovingly stitched in memory of a pirate called Rose. | A spyglass this pretty will surely always spot the finest treasures. |

| Wild Rose Beard | Wild Rose Wheel | Lament for Wild Rose |
| --------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| A well-trimmed beard perfectly suited to a dashing romantic hero. | A wheel fashioned by Wild Rose, which surely will never veer from the path your heart's desires. | After the original music box was lost, Madame Olive commissioned this replacement piece. |

| Wild Rose Waxed Hair | Barbary Wild Rose Outfit | Capuchin Wild Rose Outfit |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| An updo perfect for when you don't want hair blowing in your face and spoiling a romantic moment. | Barbary monkeys are quite tough-looking creatures. Soften those edges with this Rose outfit. | Capuchin? More like capturin' our hearts! Right? |

| Wild Rose Capstan | Wild Rose Pocket Watch | Wild Rose Boots |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| Could this ruby-red capstan result in love at first wind for the pirates who turn it? | Crafted as a gift for Rose after the tenth time she was late for a date with George. | Crafted as a wedding present for Rose, though sadly she never received them. |

| Wild Rose Captain's Curtains | Macaw Wild Rose Outfit | Wild Rose Music Box |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| Curtains fashioned from the first Crate of Luxurious Cloth Rose and George ever plundered together. | Eight out of 10 Macaws prefer to be dressed like this, probably. We haven't actually asked yet. | Embrace the romance and sway away the night with this music-lovers' dream. |

| Wild Rose Rapier | Wild Rose Floral Hair | Wild Rose Drum |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| Even the smallest of thorns can sting when wielded by a trained hand. | Fresh blooms are hard to come by out on the seas, but they're a constant reminder of the beauty of the world. | George and Rose learnt to play drums from Merrick. Thankfully, they didn't summon any megalodons. |

| Wild Rose Hook | Wild Rose Captain's Chair | Wild Rose Cutlass |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- |
| George made this for Rose to warn her that she might need it if she didn't stop feeding the sharks. | George once paid a Captain a huge sum of gold for this chair. Later, Rose stole it back again. | Gifted to Rose by her paramour George, designed to complement her beauty... and sharpness. |

| Cockatoo Wild Rose Outfit | Wild Rose Blunderbuss | Parakeet Wild Rose Outfit |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Give your Cockatoo a lovely flowery appearance, but don't lose it in the bushes. | It's said that Wild Rose never took to using a blunderbuss, but had this made to complete her set. | No longer will your Parakeet be insufficiently floral. |

| Wild Rose Concertina | Wild Rose Gloves | Wild Rose Captain's Bed |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| One thing Rose never mastered was the concertina, since she couldn't have a hand free for battle. | Pretty but tougher than they seem, just like Rose - actually, she said the same about George. | Rose always found this mattress too soft, and preferred to sleep in the crow's nest. |

| Wild Rose Captain's Rugs | Wild Rose Captain's Table | Wild Rose Tankard |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Rose and George spent many nights practising their wedding dance upon this gorgeous rug. | Rose and George would drag this table ashore on clear nights and eat together, under the stars. | Rose drank out of a tankard just like this one. The original was gifted to Madame Olivia. |

| Wild Rose Fishing Rod | Wild Rose Eyepatch | Wild Rose Dress |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| Rose had a fishing rod just like this, but saved it for special occasions. It's too nice to get wet! | Rose herself only used an eyepatch when she needed to sleep with one eye open. | Rose was fierce, competent and fearless. She and her beloved George are beyond harm's reach now. |

| Wild Rose Heavy Sword | Marmoset Wild Rose Outfit | Wild Rose Flintlock |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Sometimes you'll be called upon to protect what you love, no matter what it takes. | That's one sweet Marmoset. What a heartbreaker. | The elegant personal pistol of Wild Rose, responsible for many a visit to the Ferryman. |

| Wild Rose Lantern | Wild Rose Sails | Wild Rose Captain's Chandelier |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| The light of this lantern glows as warmly as the light between George and Rose. | The memory of Wild Rose will forever be honoured by the crimson bloom on these exquisite sails. | These candles are remnants of a romantic dinner Rose and George once shared at Boulder Cay. |

| Wild Rose Trousers | Wild Rose Belt | Wild Rose Hurdy-Gurdy |
| ------------------ | -------------- | --------------------- |
| These durable trousers are modelled on the ones Rose wore to go hiking around Cannon Cove. | This attractive belt is ideal for the kind of pirate who wins hearts and steals treasure. | This delicate instrument looks and sounds as elegant as Wild Rose herself. |

| Wild Rose Flag | Wild Rose Bucket | Wild Rose Jacket |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| This gentle rose is a reminder that peace and love will always have their place, no matter the odds against them. | This is a lovely bucket and it would be an awful shame if you were to be sick in it. | This jacket was based on the attire of Wild Rose, a pirate beloved by all. |

| Wild Rose Captain's Drapes | Wild Rose Speaking Trumpet |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| When romance is flourishing, drapes can be essential for some pirate privacy. | Wild Rose knew that looking pretty was nice, but being loud was fun. |
