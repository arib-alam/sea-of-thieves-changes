# Boarhunter

| Boarhunter Cutlass | Boarhunter Hull | Boarhunter Wheel |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ---------------- |
| A boar's tusks may be sharp, but you keep your blade sharper. | A jagged paint job that evokes the plentiful pointy parts of your preferred prey. | A skull strapped to the wheel is a popular pick for a pirate ship. Tusks, though, that's new. |

| Boarhunter Figurehead | Boarhunter Cannons | Boarhunter Sails |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Can you imagine the size of the beast that grew these immense tusks? | Cannons are usually a little... overzealous for a hunter, but they'll always be a pirate's best friend. | Don't lose your nerve, just take the boar by the horns. What? You've never heard that saying? |

| Boarhunter Gloves | Boarhunter Jacket | Boarhunter Collector's Figurehead |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Fitted with loops to keep hold of keen-edged keepsakes and spiky souvenirs. | No matter how many times you wash it, this jacket always smells faintly musky. | Ramming enemy ships is that much more satisfying when you have a boar leading the charge. |

| Boarhunter Collector's Sails | Boarhunter Blunderbuss | Boarhunter Pistol |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| Show that you're not after the small fry, those puny island pigs. You only tussle with top-tier tuskers. | Stopping power over elegance is the correct choice when your targets are charging right at you. | Teeth, tusks and a trigger. Technically you don't even need two of those, but who's checking? |

| Boarhunter Capstan | Boarhunter Boots | Boarhunter Flag |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| The trap might not catch anything, but it should dissuade anyone who's thinking of messing with your anchor. | These boots make for highly satisfying, if messy, tools for kicking anyone who tries to grab your coin purse. | They say amazing things can happen when pigs fly. Let's hope the same's true of boars. |

| Boarhunter Trinket | Boarhunter Eye of Reach | Boarhunter Hat |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------- |
| Whatever you do, don't leave this lying around on your ship and forget where you put it. | When you're tracking something with tusks, taking it out from afar is generally advisable. | Who needs peripheral vision when you can look this intimidating? |
