# Beachcomber's Bounty

| Petal Storm Emote | Beachcomber's Bounty Eye of Reach | Beachcomber's Bounty Sails |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| No description | &quot;An Eye of Reach made from bamboo? That'll never work!&quot; The last words of this weapon's first victim. | A testament to one pirate's sowing skills - these verdant sails are patched together from assorted foliage and the ragged remains of old sailing sheets. |

| Beachcomber's Bounty Cannon Flare | Baleful Bloom Costume 1 | Baleful Bloom Costume 2 |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Add some flower power to your next salvo with this floral Cannon Flare. | After a tropical pleasure cruise was beset by a brutal tempest, this summery outfit was the only thing the one surviving tourist could wear. | As the mysterious flower on their necklace began to bloom, this marooned mariner's body sprouted floral protrusions... |

| Collector's Beachcomber's Bounty Figurehead | Beachcomber's Bounty Blunderbuss | Beachcomber's Bounty Cannons |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Be careful of taking a deep breath around this overgrown figurehead with its twisting vines and mysterious spores. | Don't be fooled by its primitive design - being shot by this coconut gun is gonna hurt. | Forget iron and steel - the future of naval combat lies in coconut-based engineering, as these miraculously functional cannons prove. |

| Beachcomber's Bounty Cutlass | Beachcomber's Bounty Wheel | Beachcomber's Bounty Flag |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| If the rusted edge of this crusty cutlass doesn't best your foe, you can always blow into the conch for help. | If you're bored while waiting for your crewmates to load treasure aboard, try building a sandcastle in this rickety wheel's sandpit. | In the absence of sailcloth, a giant leaf is the perfect flag material substitute. Failing that, you can fan yourself with it. |

| Collector's Beachcomber's Bounty Sails | Beachcomber's Bounty Figurehead | Baleful Bloom Costume 3 |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| It's a marvel how a lone beachcomber managed to weave these sails out of nothing but some twigs, palm fronds and flower petals. | It's unclear whether the palm tree for this makeshift figurehead is just for show or actually holding the entire ship together. | Now nothing but a host for a parasitic plant, this poor pirate merely serves to spread its spores across the Sea of Thieves. |

| Beachcomber's Bounty Pistol | Beachcomber's Bounty Hull | Beachcomber's Bounty Capstan |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| There'll be shell to pay if you laugh at the sight of this crudely crafted pistol. | This hull's greenish hue is not down to a shipwright's slipshod paint job - it's actually a thick layer of moss. | This tropical capstan is built from the remains of an older capstan, destroyed during a humongous storm. Is it still the same capstan? |
