# Sawbones

| Sawbones Flag | Sawbones Collector's Sails | Sawbones Capstan |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- |
| At the top of the crow's nest beside this flag is the least hazardous place to be on your ship. | Chemical fumes have eaten away at the cloth in a grisly reminder of failed experiments. | Even thinking of the squeal of rusted metal this makes is enough to set your teeth on edge. |

| Sawbones Jacket | Sawbones Blunderbuss | Sawbones Pistol |
| --------------- | -------------------- | --------------- |
| Getting too close to this jacket will make your eyes and nose start to burn. | Getting too close to this weapon is a hazard to your health for a lot of reasons. | Honestly, it's amazing that this pistol still works. |

| Sawbones Cannon Flare | Sawbones Cannons | Sawbones Wheel |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| Is this sanitary? It feels unsanitary. | It's normally against procedure to strap volatile potions to your cannons, but you sail by your own rules. | Mind your fingers! More than one careless corsair has lost a few digits to this contraption. |

| Sawbones Collector's Figurehead | Sawbones Hull | Sawbones Figurehead |
| ------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Nobody is quite sure whether science of spectres are responsible for this figurehead's sickly glow. | The boards creak and hiss like an echo of the experiments that have taken place below deck. | The lifeless mask is a dread harbinger to any who spy your ship's approach. |

| Sawbones Sails | Sawbones Belt | Sawbones Eye of Reach |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| The mask's soulless gaze never wavers from the horizon. | There's got to be a more practical way of carrying all these flasks around. | Time may have corroded and warped this weapon, but its aim is as true as ever. |

| Sawbones Hat | Sawbones Gloves | Sawbones Trinket |
| ------------ | --------------- | ---------------- |
| With so many potion fumes choking the air around you, the mask is an absolute must. | Years of working with dangerous concoctions have left your hands looking almost inhuman. | You never know when you might need a flask of eyeballs close at hand. |

| Sawbones Cutlass |
| ---------------- |
| You really don't want to know what this cutlass has been used for in the past. |
