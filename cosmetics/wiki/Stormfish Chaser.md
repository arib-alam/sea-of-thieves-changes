# Stormfish Chaser

| Stormfish Chaser Pistol | Stormfish Chaser Cannon Flare | Stormfish Chaser Blunderbuss |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |

| Stormfish Chaser Hat | Storm Strike Curse | Stormfish Chaser Collector's Figurehead |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| In the lashing deluge of a storm, you'll need a sturdy hat to keep the rain off your face. | Inviting in the power of a storm can have drastic consequences. | Light the way forwards on the darkest of nights with your very own fragment of elemental force. |

| Stormfish Chaser Capstan | Stormfish Chaser Collector's Sails | Stormfish Chaser Wheel |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Maybe relying on a weathervane for directions in a hurricane wasn't your brightest idea. | No-one will question your abilities after you catch a Stormfish big enough to match these sails. | Sometimes you have to ask yourself if forging a wheel out of iron and sailing into a storm is a good idea. |

| Stormfish Chaser Cannon | Stormfish Chaser Hull | Stormfish Chaser Flag |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| The metal might be rusted by endless rain, but it'll hold a while yet. | The paintwork hasn't held up to all the storms it's endured, but at least the scars look cool. | The top of the mast is a bad place to be in a hurricane, but this Stormfish doesn't seem to mind. |

| Stormfish Chaser Sails | Stormfish Chaser Figurehead | Stormfish Chaser Jacket |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| They might be ragged and rain-soaked, but these sails will get you where you're going even in the worst weather. | What better figure to guide you through the wilds of a storm than a Twilight Stormfish? | Years of enduring inclement weather have left the fabric battered and scarred. |

| Stormfish Chaser Hook | Stormfish Chaser Eye of Reach | Stormfish Chaser Cutlass |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| You'll need a dependable hook if you're looking to snag a Stormfish. | You'll need a keen eye and a steady hand to hit your shots while being battered by a tempest. | You'll want to be wary of waving this cutlass around in a storm, lest it befriend one of the bolts it resembles. |
