# Wailing Barnacle

| Pegleg of the Wailing Barnacle | Bucket of The Wailing Barnacle | Capstan of the Wailing Barnacle |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| A barnacle-encrusted pegleg - probably better than having barnacles stuck to your real leg. | A bucket that spent a long time underwater and probably wants a break from all that wet stuff. | A fine, nautical capstan - though its last ship still languishes on the ocean floor. |

| Macaw Outfit of the Wailing Barnacle | Wheel of the Wailing Barnacle | Rapier of the Wailing Barnacle |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| A rugged, sea-worn outfit for a rugged, sea-worn bird. | A ship's wheel that has spent a bit too much time on the wrong side of the waves. | A slimmer blade attracts fewer barnacles if left on the sea bed. Blacksmiths - always thinking. |

| Heavy Sword of the Wailing Barnacle | Capuchin Outfit of the Wailing Barnacle | Eye of Reach of The Wailing Barnacle |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| A weighty blade which will leave adorable barnacle indentations on your enemies. | Astoundingly, the pegleg doesn't affect this Capuchin's rigging-climbing abilities in the slightest. | Both a long-range weapon and a way to watch out for your favourite sealife. |

| Gloves of the Wailing Barnacle | Speaking Trumpet of The Wailing Barnacle | Drum of the Wailing Barnacle |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Don't be surprised if there's a starfish living inside one or both of these gloves. | Don't be surprised if this old trumpet from the depths merely produces a stream of bubbles. | Dredged up from a shipwreck, this drum plays with the echoes of the deep. |

| Cutlass of The Wailing Barnacle | Tattoo Set of The Wailing Barnacle | Dipped Hair of the Wailing Barnacle |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| From the wreck of the Wailing Barnacle, this blade seems fun but has a treacherous legacy... | Get inked up with the art of the ocean, declaring your love of all things watery. | Gives the effect that you've just emerged from a bracing dip. Down to the sea bed. For some time. |

| Hurdy-Gurdy of the Wailing Barnacle | Whippet Outfit of the Wailing Barnacle | Inu Outfit of the Wailing Barnacle |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| However badly you might play, you'll always have a rapt audience of barnacles. | If you don't keep an eye on them, you'll probably find your pooch chewing the coral. | It's amazing this Inu was able to sit still long enough to acquire a few barnacles. |

| Beard of the Wailing Barnacle | Tagged Hair of the Wailing Barnacle | Lantern of The Wailing Barnacle |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Keep that silken chin fluff snug in the event of unforeseen sinkage. | Let your crew wonder if it's the latest style or just bits of coral caught in your locks. | Lights up even the dingiest shipwrecks, perfect for some fast looting. |

| Alsatian Outfit of the Wailing Barnacle | Tankard of The Wailing Barnacle | Figurehead of the Wailing Barnacle |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Look at how excited this pup is to show you all these cool barnacles it found! | Perfect for raising a toast to the open sea. Especially if you drink seaweed shandies. | Perhaps this figurehead will appease the spirits of the ocean, but it did its last owner no favours. |

| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Play a seaworthy shanty on this banjo that seems perfect for fans of all things fishy. | Raise a flag for your fellow sea-lovers, for all those who truly love the deep will find kinship. | Sails designed for true sea-lovers, especially those that don't mind seeing the bottom of it! |

| Cannons of the Wailing Barnacle | Fishing Rod of The Wailing Barnacle | Pocket Watch of The Wailing Barnacle |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Salvaged from The Wailing Barnacle, a ship once sailed by the notorious Stitcher Jim! | Somewhat ironically, this fishing rod first had to be fished out of the sea. | Still works and keeps excellent time, but sometimes makes you feel peckish. |

| Blunderbuss of The Wailing Barnacle | Cockatoo Outfit of the Wailing Barnacle | Barbary Outfit of the Wailing Barnacle |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Suited for the water, this blunderbuss may be the only thing between you and a shark's stomach. | The bird found the hat with some driftwood. Whoever made such a thing? | The jacket grants any monkey a very distinguished air that's only partially ruined by the smell of brine. |

| Belt of the Wailing Barnacle | Trousers of the Wailing Barnacle | Boots of the Wailing Barnacle |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| The Wailing Barnacle's captain wore this belt while diving for rare treasures. | There may be deep-sea critters squirming around in these trousers, but they're more scared of you... | These boots have walked across the seabed in search of underwater artefacts! |

| Pistol of the Wailing Barnacle | Hook of the Wailing Barnacle | Wildcat Outfit of the Wailing Barnacle |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| This barnacle-encrusted pistol has sent many pirates to a watery grave. | This hook has been submerged for so long, it went from rusty to... crusty. | This is the most regal a cat covered in seaweed and brine has ever looked. |

| Ragamuffin Outfit of the Wailing Barnacle | Marmoset Outfit of the Wailing Barnacle | Eyepatch of the Wailing Barnacle |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| This kitty might not be a natural seafarer, but it's worth it for all the fish on offer. | This monkey spent ages collecting things from the sea to decorate their jacket. Isn't it fabulous? | This oceanic eyepatch keeps that stinging seawater out of your eye. |

| Parakeet Outfit of the Wailing Barnacle | Shovel of The Wailing Barnacle | Compass of The Wailing Barnacle |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| This Parakeet spent hours picking the perfect pieces of coral to adorn its tiny hat. | This watery shovel should serve you well, but the sand does seem to stick to it. | Trust this compass to guide you true, unlike its previous owner. |

| Spyglass of The Wailing Barnacle | Concertina of the Wailing Barnacle | Hull of the Wailing Barnacle |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Used by Stitcher Jim, before his ship went down. Should have used it to watch for danger! | Watch out for squirting jets of seawater when you play this soggy concertina. | Watery hull liveries that will help your vessel blend in with the waves it glides upon. |

| Mau Outfit of the Wailing Barnacle | Jacket of The Wailing Barnacle | Hat of The Wailing Barnacle |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| What Mau wouldn't appreciate a little coat to keep them dry when out at sea? | You fell in the drink so often that you decided to embrace it. Never mind the barnacles. | You may get the odd fishy look, but this hat belongs to a true sea-lover. |
