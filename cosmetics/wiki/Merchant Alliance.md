| Merchant Alliance Cutlass | Merchant Alliance Eyepatch | Measly Merchant Spyglass |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| A fine piratical blade that's useful for cutting through the paperwork. | A fine, golden monocle that should serve nicely as an eyepatch as long as nobody astonishes you. | A glance of things to come, this spyglass only requires you to help out a few pitiful customers. |

| Merchant Alliance Hook | Famed Merchant Watch | Merchant Alliance Blunderbuss |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| A hook that seems to have been fashioned from a pair of compasses. The Merchants do despise wasting things... | A lovely timepiece that would complete any outfit, yours by keeping renowned customers happy. | A noisy and imprecise weapon that Merchants only use when there's no practical alternative. |

| Merchant Alliance Pistol | Merchant Alliance Emissary Flag | Lowly Merchant Watch |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | -------------------- |
