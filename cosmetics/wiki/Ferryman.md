# Ferryman

| Ferryman Blunderbuss | Ferryman Jacket | Ferryman Gloves |
| -------------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Converted from guns thrown away in anger by crews who failed to overcome the skeleton strongholds. | For decades the Ferry Captain's been working on an anti-Ferry coating, but it's not quite there yet. | Found in the Ferry's list property barrel, hopefully you'll get a matching pair. |

| Ferryman Belt | Ferryman Hat | Ferryman Pistol |
| ------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Issues with trousers falling down causing embarrassing Ferry visits have now been rectified. | Lesser hats sometimes slip down over eyes and cause Ferry visits, but this hat fits very tightly. | Once able to fire ten shots without reloading until the Pirate Lord deemed it unfair. |

| Ferryman Cutlass | Ferryman Eyepatch | Ferryman Hook |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| Personally sharpened up by the Ferry captain to prevent future visits to his ship. | Recently made a lot smaller, as it was obscuring both eyes and making ferry visits a formality. | Smelted from cutlasses of fallen pirates who lost the will to go on and never left the Ferry. |
