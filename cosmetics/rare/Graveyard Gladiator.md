| *A durable, no-nonsense blade for dispatching enemies in single combat. Also butters toast beautifully.* | *A flag buried with a famous warrior as a sign of respect... then dragged back to the living world and flown again.* | *A long-range weapon with some pointed remodelling to feel more suited to a close-quarters fighter.* |

| *Adapted to match the costume after other gladiators made unnecessarily scathing fashion comments.* | *Embellished with the scales of a rare and deadly beast, possibly now extinct, probably because of this.* | *If death cannot hold you, why not spend at least one lifetime scouring the seas for satisfactory opponents?* |

| *If the crew keep disrespecting your symbolic chariot by storing fish in it, you will fight every last one of them.* | *It didn't work too well as a spoked chariot wheel, so it's much less of a liability on your ship's deck.* | *More spectacle for the battleground! Are you not entertained? Tough crowd.* |
