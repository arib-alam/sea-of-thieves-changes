| A beard can symbolise many things - authority, experience and a nice warm chin,  for example. | A bright violet jacket, because a ship's Captain should never settle for being inconspicuous. | A golden crest with a purple strap, this is more like a badge of honour than an eyepatch. |

| A hat that resembles a valiant lion. Wear it with a Captain's pride! | A rugged belt with a lion's head buckle. Simple but stylish. | Boots with claws. Tread carefully when wearing them so as not to ruin your new Captain's Rugs. |

| Even famous Captains put these on one leg at a time, just like everyone else. | Follow in the Pirate Lord's footsteps by picking a peg leg with a paw. | Freshly pressed and starched, ready for whatever the new day may throw at you. |
