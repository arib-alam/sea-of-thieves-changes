| *A colourful, fine hull paint that looks regal from the yardarm to the mighty poop deck.* | If you're looking for something to even up a wonky table, this statue of a royal rodent and his golden acorn would work a treat. | *Legend says that the story of a squirrel becoming king all took place on one very bad day.* |

| *No matter how sober you were before, this wheel always seems to steer you towards an open tavern.* | *Spins around as easily as a leaping squirrel's tail, according to dubious drunken sightings.* | The crown and tankards encourage drinking with dignity. Or is it drinking with stolen jewellery? |

| *The heraldry here tells every pirate that you hoard your loot like a squirrel hoards acorns. See?* | *These make short work of weasels, goblins and bears. Oh my!* | *This depicts a rather regal rascal, clearly fond of a grog but always coming out on top!* |
