| A fine fishing rod in the hands of a disciplined user. Do you have a license for it? | A fine pair of immaculately pressed breeches that are nearly as uptight as you are. | A hat makes the pirate, so look no further than this distinguished but impractical headwear. |

| A noble weapon that will serve you admirably, so long as you remember to load it. | *A tidy, sturdy capstan that you'd find on a nice, proper vessel.* | A wooden leg doesn't lessen your duty. It's no excuse for getting stuck in the deck grille though. |

| At the wheel it's a stirring sight. Don't get too distracted, or you'll see the bottom of the sea. | Boots so shiny you can see your face in them, but no promises you'll like what you see. | Both practical and formal, in the highly unlikely chance of attending a society ball on the seas. |

| *Cannons so clean and shiny, you could eat your dinner off them! Please don't do that.* | Crafted by master horologists, but comes with no guarantee you'll be on time. | Cuts through the water with utmost authority, but remember that rocks won't show you any respect. |

| Do your duty and don't buy this, as there is no honor in fighting from range. | Don't wipe sea spray from your eyes or you'll be wearing an eyepatch too. | Extra starch ensures you’ll stay smart in the roughest of storms. Smarter pirates avoid them though. |

| Getting your hands dirty is for dishonourable types, so wear these gloves and sniff your innocence. | Give those ill-disciplined Skeleton rabble a taste of authority. If that fails, run away! | Lesser pirates will look up to you when using this. Unless you're peering through the wrong end. |

| Let your hair down a little and enjoy some music. Not too much, though. | *Lord of the seas, just like you. Pay no heed to any who say it's a outdated old man with a stick.* | Only to be used if undignified physical toil is absolutely necessary. |

| Promotes an air of undoubted experience in battle, just don't let your crew see it's just for show. | Prove you're more than just an entitled dimwit by brightening up your crew's prospects. | Remember, big end towards your enemies if you don't want a chest full of lead. |

| Ships have no room for a grand piano, so you'll have to learn how to play this instead. | Show everyone you’re not the stuffy type by occasionally enjoying a small sniff of grog. | Specially commissioned Admiral-friendly instructions. Scoop, tip, repeat. |

| Strum a nice, nautical ditty to boost morale among your sterling crew. | That flag had better be clean, starched and at regulation height! | The large buckle reflects your stature, but also increases the chance of being struck by lightning. |

| This should help keep a distance when speaking with lesser pirates is unavoidable. | Totally unrufflable, except when you get lost on a character-building trek across Old Faithful. | Trim your beard as often as your sails and you’ll be well respected. Or end up grounding your ship. |
