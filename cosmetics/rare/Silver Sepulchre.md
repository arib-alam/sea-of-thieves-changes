| *A needle-like blade primed for striking right at the cold hearts of your enemies.* | *A stake, fire and silver - everything you need to take down even the most fearsome creatures of the night.* | *A thin dusting of silver mixed in with the paint will do wonders for keeping out any ghouls.* |

| *An elegant blend of protection and style, with enough silver to warn away the worst kind of monsters.* | *Crossbows aren't as threatening to a ship as they are to a vampire, but the cannonballs certainly will be.* | *Few pirates know the symbol emblazoned on this flag, but those who do recognise you as a champion of the light.* |

| *Hunters of unnatural foes have a tradition of keeping a few silver bullets in their hat for good luck.* | *Hunting monstrous creatures of the night is often better done at a distance.* | *In a world where monsters lurk in the shadows, you can never have too many stakes.* |

| *It lacks the satisfying twang of a crossbow, but stings just the same.* | *Let these sails act as a sombre warning to any creature of the night who might think you easy prey.* | *Monsters on the Sea of Thieves may not need to fear crossbows, but they should fear you.* |

| *Pirates who don't watch themselves around this contraption are liable to lose a few fingers.* | *Ramming your enemies is not always advisable, but this figurehead will at least ensure you cause lasting damage.* | *The detailed silver plating might look decorative, but this weapon is no less devastating for it.* |

| *There's not much call for silver bullets on the Sea of Thieves, but having them close makes you feel safer all the same.* | *When you were told to always keep a stake close at hand, this probably isn't what they meant.* |
