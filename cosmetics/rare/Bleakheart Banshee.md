| *No description* | *A blade honed to cleave a heart as cleanly as that of the forlorn spirit whose family once owned it.* | *A fine hunting weapon used sparingly by a cursed line of maritime aristocracy. The curse, hopefully, isn't contagious.* |

| *A token of esteem from a great sailor to the parents of their intended bride, before the tale culminated in tragedy.* | *Creative use of a grand drawing room clock salvaged from Bleakheart Manor before it burned to the ground.* | *Cunningly refurbished with a candlestick claimed from the same ill-fated manor house. Pirates waste nothing.* |

| *Dress as a grim spectre from Sea of Thieves legend, whose devotion to a love lost at sea led to an afterlife seeking retribution.* | *In this pale livery trimmed with gold, passing ships may think you're ferrying a wedding party to their next destination.* | *Inspired by a sinister sailors' tale, the revenant on this figurehead still carries a light to guide their lost beloved home.* |

| *Mirroring the ornate gold detailing on a forgotten music box, these sails feel almost too lavish to unfurl.* | *Said to be a sign of the Banshee savouring every soul sent to the Ferry by these cannons.* | *Still clinging to hope, this solemn bride-to-be waits eternally for a soulmate who will never walk down the aisle.* |

| *Supposedly used in the ritual that transformed a heartbroken bride-to-be into a vengeful spectre. Don't worry, it's been rinsed out since then.* | *Taken down from the wall of ruined Bleakheart Manor and put to use as a powerful tool for survival on the seas.* | *The chandeliers of tragic Bleakheart Manor have long since fallen, but this one at least still serves a purpose.* |

| *The locket on this flag is the same one that binds a ghostly lover to the mortal plane in the old sailors' fable.* | *You can embrace the tale of doomed love that inspired these sails, or tell your own and hope the spirits don't take offence...* |
