| A fine, feathered hat - at least until some disrespectful pirate tries to shoot it off your head. | A neat and tidy haircut that practically radiates authority. | A royal red patch adorned with gold. You'll want to keep taking it off just so you can stare at it. |

| A sturdy hook, but don't let others get the impression you're a good-for-nothing privateer. | Bringing rule and order to the lawless seas can sometimes cost you life and limb. | Designed by royal tailors to resemble soldiers' armour while proudly displaying a naval insignia. |

| Loose-fitting trousers are helpful in a scuffle - not that you'd ever lower yourself to such behaviour. | Not exactly a regulation cut, but there's no arguing with style. | Something to stroke pensively as you study the maps of your latest seafaring campaigns. |

| Such exquisite needlework! Such style! Such flair! Try not to get grog all over it. | There's no rule that says you can't look elegant while you're scuttling every last pirate on the waves. | This belt is covered in so many gems, pickpockets may try to steal it rather than your purse. |

| Wear these at all times - it would never do for an officer to get their hands dirty. | Wearing these, you can stamp out the pirate scourge once and for all! Metaphorically, at least. |
