| *Be careful not to get locked below deck. No one has ever managed to escape from this particular vessel.* | *Could probably double as a set of lockpicks if the situation gest dire enough* | *If chains won't hold your enemies, maybe they'll be able to cut them down instead.* |

| *If the first shot isn't enough to secure a surrender, the second one steps up the persuasion.* | *If you can't imprison your foes, at least you can blow them to bits from afar!* | *Old tales speak of dangerous figures locked behind iron masks, but you are more than mere myth.* |
