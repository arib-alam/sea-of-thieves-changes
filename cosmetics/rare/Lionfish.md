| *No description* | *Adorned with the golden visage of a lionfish, the approach of these sails should hurry you to roll out the red carpet.* | *Don't be bamboozled by this kaleidoscopic pistol - you'll be seeing black if you end up on the wrong end of it.* |

| *Don't be fooled by the sweet words of crews sporting this regal but venomous flag. They'll twist the knife at a moment's notice.* | *Elbows in when turning this elegant capstan - we can't guarantee those barbs aren't venomous.* | *Expect some psychedelic jams when you're rocking out with this harlequin hurdy-gurdy. Groovy.* |

| *Like the fish it's modelled on, this multicoloured blunderbuss looks harmless but packs a mighty wallop.* | *Like the lionfish leaping out of the waves on its side, may this hull see you gliding gracefully over the ocean.* | *Rather than having the lionfish spit out cannonballs, the jester who designed these cannons made them fire from the other end.* |

| *While this cutlass' spines may not be venomous, getting poked with one doesn't half sting.* | *With its bladed edge, this opulent wheel doubles as a buzzsaw if spun fast enough. Make sure your anchor's down first though.* | *With its mouth agape, the bright red figurehead has been known to scoop up fish when sailing through choppy waters. That's your dinner sorted.* |
