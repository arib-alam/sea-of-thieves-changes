| *Anyone who fires your pet out of a cannon after you've raised these sails is really just asking for trouble.* | *Gives a new meaning to your opponents being in the doghouse, doesn't it?* | *Is there any better feeling than a ship's wheel beneath your hand, a sea breeze in your hair and a faithful pet at your side?* |

| *Many a ship's cat will enjoy exploring this capstan, though they're no help at all when raising the anchor.* | *Several pets carved from a single block of wood, giving them no real choice but to get along famously.* | *When the sun hits them just right, you could almost believe these stunning carvings have come to life.* |
