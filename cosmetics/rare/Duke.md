| A glimpse of Duke in his prime, fearlessly following his nose into adventure, battle and legend. | A sleek hull with green chevrons forming an X at the front, perhaps so that treasure comes to you. | Duke claims that this X-like, multicolour design came to him in a grog-fuelled dream. |

| Duke commissioned this ship livery for himself, using his pirating profits. Explains a few things. | Duke had an X carved on this wheel so that there would always be treasure aboard his ship - him! | This capstan is always ready to raise anchor and let the games begin. |

| Who knows what arcane power hums inside these cannons? Duke always had the edge in a fight. |
