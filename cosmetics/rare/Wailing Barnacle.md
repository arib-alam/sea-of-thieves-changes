| A barnacle-encrusted pegleg - probably better than having barnacles stuck to your real leg. | A bucket that spent a long time underwater and probably wants a break from all that wet stuff. | *A fine, nautical capstan - though its last ship still languishes on the ocean floor.* |

| *A rugged, sea-worn outfit for a rugged, sea-worn bird.* | *A ship's wheel that has spent a bit too much time on the wrong side of the waves.* | A slimmer blade attracts fewer barnacles if left on the sea bed. Blacksmiths - always thinking. |

| A weighty blade which will leave adorable barnacle indentations on your enemies. | *Astoundingly, the pegleg doesn't affect this Capuchin's rigging-climbing abilities in the slightest.* | *Both a long-range weapon and a way to watch out for your favourite sealife.* |
