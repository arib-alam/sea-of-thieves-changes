| *A flag depicting a roaring tiger, and the first to be flown in this age of the Sea of Thieves.* | *As close as any present-day pirate can get to helming the Pirate Lord's legendary ship.* | Cannons from the Magpie's Wing, the Pirate Lord's own ship! Just like him, they're still kicking. |

| *Ever the tinkerer, Shan would frequently repaint the Magpie's Wing. This is just one of his designs.* | *Like the Pirate Lord, this figurehead is cheerful and friendly - but it still has claws.* | *The Pirate Lord could always be recognised on sight, not least because of these striking sails.* |
