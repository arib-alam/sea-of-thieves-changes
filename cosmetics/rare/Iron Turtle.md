| *A figurehead so keen to sink its beak into your foes, you'll wonder why you even need your cannons.* | *A heavy capstan that's not just visually imposing but gives your crew a serious workout.* | *A sturdy shell is great, but everyone knows the best defence is really a good offence.* |

| *Admire this proud pennant as it snaps in the wind like a warning.* | *Don't ask whether armour plating on the wheel is strictly necessary. It's a look and you'e committed to it.* | *Even if you're not fast enough to chase down your oppenent, you can still strike from afar.* |

| *If only this shield was strong enough to protect your ship the next time a rock sneaks up on you.* | *No amount of natural armour is going to be enough to stop one of these at close range.* | *No shell you can scavenge in the Sea of Thieves will protect you from a bullet, but it does look very intimidating.* |

| *One shot to break through your enemy's armour, the second to dish out some damage.* | *Slow and steady may work for a tortoise, but these sails are attached to something a little speedier.* | *Something modest can still be mighty. Show your foes the true potential of smaller sidearms.* |
