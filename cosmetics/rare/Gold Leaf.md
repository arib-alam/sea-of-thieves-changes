| *Carved from the sturdiest oak, this blunderbuss is useful when a large bounty requires a powerful tool.* | Golden sails on the horizon signal joy for the desperate and despair for the decadent. | Made from the strongest trees of a faraway forest, this ship's hull cuts through the waves like an arrow. |
