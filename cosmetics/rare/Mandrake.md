| *No description* | *A hull as green as jeweled spring leaves and the faces of other crews as you ram them at full speed.* | *Botanists are absolutely entranced by this palnt-based pistol. Some are already trying to grow their own armaments.* |

| *Considering the way it keeps the wheel wrapped in vines and tendrils, it's almost like the plant is steering the ship.* | *Descend upon other ships like a rolling tide of briars, teeth, and thorns. Plants are so calming.* | *Don't go sniffing this blunderbuss' enticing flower - the only thing you'll be smelling is gunpowder. And blood.* |

| *Enemy crews can admire a tasteful cerise flourish as their hull explodes beneath them.* | *For those on long assassination missions, the foliage growing out of this gun works as fantastic camouflage.* | *Half human, half plant, all deadly - dress up as the flesh-eating Mandrake with this thorny outfit.* |

| *Half human, half plant, all deadly - dress up as the flesh-eating Mandrake with this thorny outfit.* | *It's a trap! And a hardy perennial that shrugs off brine and bad weather alike.* | *It's said that this flower takes 20 years to bloom, and the aroma could fell in elephant. Let's hope it doesn't happen during an anchor turn.* |

| *Knotted with thorny vines and other flora, these brassy cannons need maintaining with a pair of secateurs.* | *Pirates swear that this bristly speaking trumpet is whispering for someone to feed it.* | *Shows a neat curl of spiky vine, not a bramble fishing hook, although pirates will try anything once.* |

| *Thanks to the ravenous plant that grows from this brass blade, it quite literally thirsts for blood.* | *These sails depict the predatory power of the mandrake in full bloom, terrifying other crews even in the dead of night.* | *This variant of the mandrake mutates in unexpected ways. Those jaws will look truly fearsome at the bow of your ship.* |
