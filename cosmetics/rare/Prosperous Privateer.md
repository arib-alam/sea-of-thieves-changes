| A fine hat adorned with plumage from some of the plumpest parrots you ever did see. | A group forged during the early days of the Sea of Thieves, the Prosperous Privateers display their wealth with stylish apparel like this. | A hardy coat that has lasted through thick and thin, even after many years sailing the Sea of Thieves. |

| Far from the only golden eyepatch on the waves, but who needs originality when you're filthy rich? | If you arrive in the Sea of Thieves with nothing but the shirt on your back, you can at least make sure it's a stylish one. | Proper hand coverings are essential when you're handling such incredible amounts of money every day. |

| Scrubbing your locks in the water barrel every morning is essential for maintaining a healthy head of hair. | The buckle alone is worth more than some Galleons. At least, that's what you can tell everyone. | The distinguished streaks are a sure sign of a long life at sea, well lived. |

| The Prosperous Privateers love reminding people that they pulled themselves up by the straps on these. | The quality of the stitching on these is remarkable, considering the tailor was being held at sword-point. | The story behind this impressive pegleg is just one of many that the youth of today wouldn't believe. |

| There were no Alliance flags in the early days of the Sea of Thieves, which meant plenty of confrontations – and consequences… | When the rest of your outfit is so impressive, it's hard work to make your hair look equally stunning. |
