| Never let the scales fall from your eyes with this fine, fishy facial design. | Tattoos of tides and tridents are a great way to prove your lifelong devotion to the mysteries of the sea. | The trident has long been considered a powerful symbol of the seas, and would make an excellent fork for Megalodon meat. |

| Tridents and scale motifs pay tribute to the merfolk, who are sure to appreciate the gesture if they return you to your ship. | Years of catching fish bare-handed have left you with a series of scars that might be mistaken for scales of your own. |
