| *A boar's tusks may be sharp, but you keep your blade sharper.* | *A jagged paint job that evokes the plentiful pointy parts of your preferred prey.* | *A skull strapped to the wheel is a popular pick for a pirate ship. Tusks, though, that's new.* |

| *Can you imagine the size of the beast that grew these immense tusks?* | *Cannons are usually a little... overzealous for a hunter, but they'll always be a pirate's best friend.* | *Don't lose your nerve, just take the boar by the horns. What? You've never heard that saying?* |

| *Fitted with loops to keep hold of keen-edged keepsakes and spiky souvenirs.* | *No matter how many times you wash it, this jacket always smells faintly musky.* | *Ramming enemy ships is that much more satisfying when you have a boar leading the charge.* |

| *Show that you're not after the small fry, those puny island pigs. You only tussle with top-tier tuskers.* | *Stopping power over elegance is the correct choice when your targets are charging right at you.* | *Teeth, tusks and a trigger. Technically you don't even need two of those, but who's checking?* |

| *The trap might not catch anything, but it should dissuade anyone who's thinking of messing with your anchor.* | *These boots make for highly satisfying, if messy, tools for kicking anyone who tries to grab your coin purse.* | *They say amazing things can happen when pigs fly. Let's hope the same's true of boars.* |

| *Whatever you do, don't leave this lying around on your ship and forget where you put it.* | *When you're tracking something with tusks, taking it out from afar is generally advisable.* | *Who needs peripheral vision when you can look this intimidating?* |
