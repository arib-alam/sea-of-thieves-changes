| A replica of Merrick's famous jacket. All of the style, none of the splashtail stains. | A toothy tankard designed by Merrick in memory of a Megalodon. Perfect if you're The Thirsting One. | A unique sword design created by Merrick. It looks just as useful for spear-fishing as it does for fighting. |
