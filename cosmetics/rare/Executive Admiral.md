| A fine pair of immaculately pressed breeches that are nearly as uptight as you are. | A hat makes the pirate, so look no further than this distinguished but impractical headwear. | A wooden leg doesn't lessen your duty. It's no excuse for getting stuck in the deck grille though. |

| Boots so shiny you can see your face in them, but no promises you'll like what you see. | Both practical and formal, in the highly unlikely chance of attending a society ball on the seas. | Don't wipe sea spray from your eyes or you'll be wearing an eyepatch too. |

| Extra starch ensures you’ll stay smart in the roughest of storms. Smarter pirates avoid them though. | Getting your hands dirty is for dishonourable types, so wear these gloves and sniff your innocence. | Promotes an air of undoubted experience in battle, just don't let your crew see it's just for show. |

| The large buckle reflects your stature, but also increases the chance of being struck by lightning. | Totally unrufflable, except when you get lost on a character-building trek across Old Faithful. | Trim your beard as often as your sails and you’ll be well respected. Or end up grounding your ship. |
